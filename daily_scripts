 In general

(1) Throughout the paper (including in Tables, etc.), (a) the "branching ratio" is used on L246 and L302, while (b) the "branching fraction" is used on L30 and Table 2 (the header column and the theoretical uncertainties block),

I'm not sure whether they should be consistent, i.e.

either all with (a) or all with (b) instead of a mixture.

(2) In all Figures (the axis labels, plot labels and legends) and Tables (header rows and header columns), the 1st letter of each line should be capital, e.g.

(a) Figs.1 and 3's legends:

"data ... ... single top W+jets Drell-Yan dibosons multijet uncertainty" -->

"Data ... ... Single top W+jets Drell-Yan Dibosons Multijet Uncertainty"

(b) Table 1's header row: (the 3rd line)

"background-like | signal-like | background-like | signal-like" --> "Background-like | Signal-like | Background-like | Signal-like"

(c) The other places where should be changed similarly are

Fig.2's legend, Table 1's header column (some rows), Fig.3's plot labels (at the upper-right corner of each plot), Table 2's header row (the 2nd line) and header column (some rows), and Fig.4 (the legend and the horizontal axis label).

Pages 1-4

(3) L30, L81, L95, L97, L111-112, L127, L140 and L142-143. These lines may be shortened from

(a) L30: (as the "h" has been explained on L29)

"branching fractions B(tauh -> hadrons + nutau)" --> "branching fractions B(tauh -> h + nutau)"

(b) L81: (as the NLO has been introduced on L62; also, the number of adjectives before the "cross section" seems a little too many, so two words of "At the" and a comma may be better to be added around the 1st word)

"The next-to-next-to-leading-order (NNLO) expected SM ttbar pair production cross section of" -->

"At the next-to-NLO (NNLO), the expected SM ttbar pair production cross section of"

(c) L95: "with a particle-flow (PF) algorithm [28]. The PF algorithm ..." --> "with a particle-flow (PF) algorithm [28]. This algorithm ..."

(d) L97: "namely charged hadrons, photons, neutral hadrons, muons," --> "namely charged and neutral hadrons, photons, muons,"

(e) L111-112: (two places)

"if Irel > 0.0588 in the barrel and Irel > 0.0571 in the endcaps. The muon candidate is rejected if Irel > 0.15 in both the barrel and the endcaps." -->

"if Irel > 0.0588 (0.0571) in the barrel (endcaps). The muon candidate is rejected if Irel > 0.15 in both the barrel and endcaps."

(f) L127: "is taken as the sum of the charges of the charged hadrons (prongs) in ..." --> "is taken as the charge sum of the charged hadrons (prongs) in ..."

(g) L140: (as the "phi" and "eta" have already been explained on L46-47)

"> 0.4, where phi is the azimuthal angle and eta is the pseudorapidity." --> "> 0.4."

(h) L142-143: "if Irel < 0.0994 in the barrel and Irel < 0.107 in the endcaps." --> "if Irel < 0.0994 (0.107) in the barrel (endcaps)."

(4) L33, it'll be looked and sound better if a comma is added, i.e.

"In this measurement l does not include leptons from ..." --> "In this measurement, l does not include leptons from ..."

(5) L62, to be consistent in this paper (e.g. L161, etc.), two spaces should be added before and after the symbol "=", i.e.

"mt=172.5 GeV." --> "mt = 172.5 GeV."

(6) L69, to be consistent in this paper (e.g. L68, etc.) and with all other CMS papers, a hyphen should be added between the "s channel", i.e.

"The single top quark s channel is produced" --> "The single top quark s-channel is produced"

(7) L74, L100 and L135-136. The "ME" and "pT" should be explained at their 1st appearances in text on L74 and L100 instead of L135-136 for "pT", i.e.

(a) L74: (as the "ME" has been used later in this paper)

"for in the matrix-element calculations." --> "for in the matrix-element (ME) calculations."

(b) L100: "vectorial sum of transverse momenta of all reconstructed" --> "vectorial sum of transverse momenta (pT) of all reconstructed"

(c) L135-136: (then can be shortened correspondingly)

"with transverse momentum pT > 30 (26) GeV and ..." --> "with pT > 30 (26) GeV and ..."

(8) L146, the expression of "a b tagging efficiency" is looked quite odd similar as "a b c d xxxx". It may be improved by following the good examples in this paper (e.g. L158-159, L162, L164 and L315, etc.) to add a hyphen between "b tagging", i.e.

"in a b tagging efficiency of about 66% with" --> "in a b-tagging efficiency of about 66% with"

(9) L153-154, I've not figured out what the "(MT in the following)" is used for in this sentence yet. If it would not be too meaningful here, then whether it can be removed?

Pages 7-8

(10) L258 and L283, as the "PS" has been used on L260, it should be explained at its 1st appearance in text on L258, i.e.

(a) L258: "in parton showering simulation of ..." --> "in parton showering (PS) simulation of ..."

(b) L283: (then, can be shortened by using "PS")

"and parton shower modeling" --> "and PS modeling"

(11) L258-259, L268 and Table 1's caption (the 3rd line) may be shortened from

(a) L258-259: "of final-state and initial-state radiation," --> "of final- and initial-state radiation,"

(b) L268: "as described in the Section 6," --> "as described in Section 6,"

(c) Table 1's caption (the 3rd line):

"in the background-like and signal-like event categories." --> "in the background- and signal-like event categories."

(12) L276, to be consistent in this paper, the font of electron "e" should be changed from

"as a function of the cross section in the e(italic)tauh and ..." --> "as a function of the cross section in the e(non-italic)tauh and ..."

Page 11

(13) L289-290, I'm not sure whether the "acceptance" should be plural, i.e.

"is the product of the geometrical and kinematic acceptance," --> "is the product of the geometrical and kinematic acceptances,"

Page 12

(14) L325, per the PubComm guidelines, some acronyms and variables (e.g. "SM", etc.) in the Summary Section may should be explained (or spelled out if it would not be used again in the Section at their 1st appearances in the Section, since some readers may only read the Summary Section instead of whole paper, i.e.

"in agreement with SM expectations." --> "in agreement with Standard Model expectations."

Pages 13-16, in the References Section

(15) L351, in [1], I'm not sure whether three words in the article title should be in the lower case, i.e.

"Test of Lepton Flavor Universality by the measurement of the" --> "Test of lepton flavor universality by the measurement of the"

Other ones which also need to be similarly modified are [3] (for the 2nd word "Anatomy") and [43] (for the last word "Pole").

(16) L434, in [30], to be consistent with all other CMS papers, the document name should be changed from

"Technical Report CMS-DP-2017-004, 2017." --> "CMS Detector Performance Report CMS-DP-2017-004, 2017."

(17) L469, in [42], to be consistent in this Section, the Erratum should be changed from "[Erratum: Phys. Rev. D 66, 079905 (2002)]." --> "[Erratum: Phys. Rev. D 66 (2002) 079905].

(18) L478, in [46], this is a Collaboration paper, so that the individual name should be removed from the author part, i.e.

"[46] Particle Data Group, M. Tanabashi et al.," --> "[46] Particle Data Group,"

## Physics comments (Type B)

 In addition, there are two points in particular that we would like to see addressed by the analysis team, first regarding the presentation of the extracted cross section values, and second regarding the fit construction and interpretation of results.

In Section 8 ("Results"), a single "acceptance" factor is reported that related the "visible" and "total" cross sections for the ttbar process. The quoted "acceptance" appears to include both the purely geometric acceptance factor (e.g. due to kinematic selections on reconstructed objects) as well as the detector-specific efficiency (e.g. from lepton and tau ID, trigger, etc.). It would be useful to separate these two contributions into "acceptance" and "efficiency" corrections and to quote an efficiency-corrected visible cross section. This would allow for a comparison of these results with those from other experiments and with the correction factors predicted by other theory models.

The treatment of decay channels involving tau leptons that are not considered as a part of the signal process would benefit from a more detailed discussion and comes up in several of the physics comments below. This measurement is motivated in the paper by its ability to probe anomalous tau lepton production in top decays, which in addition to the "e/mu+hadronic tau" signal considered here would also affect ttbar channels involving (a) one fully leptonic tau decay, (b) two fully leptonic tau decays, (c) one hadronic and one fully leptonic tau decay, and (d) two hadronic tau decays. In this analysis, each of these processes is treated as a background. Both (a) and (b) are included in the signal definition of Ref.[7] and (c) is treated as a background here despite having an experimental signature identical to the signal process. This treatment could lead to a scenario where anomalously large tau production is present in nature, but would increase the size of both signal and background in this analysis, so that a signal strength consistent with the SM is still observed. Similarly, the contribution of tau production to both the numerator and denominator of the ratio R_Gamma (L306) implies that a measurement might be consistent with the SM value, despite the presence of real sources of anomalous tau production in top decays.

It should be clarified in the text whether the signal strength modifier is also applied to background processes involving taus from top decays. If not, consider modifying the fit setup to coherently treat all top decays involving taus. In the introduction of the ratios R_ltau/ll (L298) and R_Gamma (L306), the effect of processes involving taus from top decays that are not considered as signal in this analysis should be explicitly discussed. This is necessary for the reader to properly interpret the results in terms of limits on anomalous tau production and lepton universality.

## Type B Comments ###############

Abstract: Indicate here why the result is significant (e.g., first measurement at 13 TeV that explicitly includes a tau lepton in the final state).

Introduction: Add a Feynman diagram, which is generally useful to improve the clarity of the paper.

6-9: State already here whether you consider tt > (tau nu b)(tau nu b) with one hadronic and one fully leptonic decay as a part of your signal. Also the abstract directly talks about tau_h, while this is more general, just saying tau. It would improve the clarity to discuss the signal in more explicit terms.

8: “5/81” and “4/81” - better elaborate on your “81” (at least). The fractions 5/81 and 4/81 (slightly) confuse channel fractions with branching fractions. Also, the sentence has to be read carefully to understand that the numerators refer to dilepton decays whereas the denominators refer to all decays. And the argument that 5/81>4/81 is misleading since, as explained in the fourth paragraph, the tau decays are restricted to the hadronic channel (and 1/81 corresponds to tau tau).

11: The “this” in “In this final state” should be spelled out since it refers back to the preceding paragraph.

14: How would the anomalous tau production manifest itself? As there are existing high-precision ttbar measurements involving tau decays, would these other decay modes be modified enough to already see the effects to which you are sensitive? For example, the measurement in the e+mu- channel would be affected.

33: The statement as written here begs the question: if prompt leptons are difficult to distinguish from leptonic tau leptons, why do you choose to exclude this process from your signal selection, including "prompt" leptons and not the ones from tau lepton decays?

42: Use the latest version of the “CMS detector” material as there have been a few changes since the form used in the paper was released.

54: momentum balance, instead of energy. (This may be fixed in the newer detector reference.)

65: State how many jets are included in the LO matrix element calculation for W/Z+jets.

68: How is the interference with ttbar treated in the tW simulation? Is a theoretical uncertainty assessed by comparing the diagram removal and subtraction schemes (https://arxiv.org/abs/0805.3067)?

72: Strictly speaking, there is more to the “event tune” than CUETP8M2T4, which is the “underlying event tune”.

79: It’s not clear how the 69.2 mb fits into the pileup weighting. If it is used to create a pre-distribution of PVs per event, then it has only an indirect role in the weighting process. And since many of the quantities are “pileup safe” it’s not clear why the reader needs to know this number. There are other numbers such as the PDG value for the top quark mass or the uncertainty in the cross section due to the top quark mass that would seem to be much more relevant.

82: Consider also stating the uncertainty due to the top quark mass assumption. It is appropriate for a 'measurement' paper and the uncertainty is larger than that due to scale variations.

92: This section might be improved by better organization. For example, you define in l.104ff the electron/muon isolation, including the cut values for tight leptons, and then multiple paragraphs later (l.142) the values for veto leptons. It would be clearer to first discuss all of the object-level selections (e.g. loose and tight leptons) before the event selection.

111-112 (142,...): The “magic” numbers should be explained or referenced : “0.0588”, “0.0571”, “0.15” too ; there are some others on other lines (142, …, 260-261, ...) If these correspond to some fixed signal efficiency (e.g. in Z->ll events), please quote it.

126: Please clarify that “genuine tau leptons” here refers specifically to the hadronic tau decay. Suggest changing tau to tau_h.

140: “where phi is …, and eta is ...” - those are already defined on line 46-47, so no need to declare them again. (But the standard practice is to provide a reference as part of the detector section and not to give a formula for eta.)

142: For electrons and muons that exceed the reconstructed pt thresholds the “loose” definition also includes lower bounds, e.g. 0.15< Irel < 0.25 for muons, as otherwise they would simply be “isolated”. Also, the “rejected” on lines 111 and 112 is too harsh as some of those muons could have been still considered as “loose” candidates...Clarify whether “loose” and “isolated” are inclusive or exclusive. (See also the above comment on L92)

149: It would be instructive to explicitly quote the signal purity after the full event selection here, plus perhaps also the contamination from the remaining ttbar decay channels.

Sec 4.: Are the leptons matched to the triggered objects?

153: Logically it should be “M_T(\vec{p}^l_T,\vec{p}_T^\text{miss} ...)” /not M_T(l,...). This should also be made consistent between the text and in the Figures (axis labels).

158: You might explicitly discuss the background from ttbar where it is not the b from t → bqq’ that has been b-tagged. (You require only ≥1 b-tagged jet, and that one could be the one from the t → blnu decay). The "wrong-tag" events presumably are the dominant ttbar contribution to your signal-rich region?

165-166: This sentence is a bit confusing. How can the cut choice on Djjbmin maximize both the signal and background-like event category yields? The cut decides one or the other, i.e. if changing Djjbmin leads to one category becoming larger, and conversely the other becoming smaller. Describe the (presumably MC-based) optimization that was done in order to select the 60 GeV value.

168: It’s never explicitly stated why mT is a good choice of observable to fit -- the signal may pass the W mass endpoint due to the two-neutrino final state whereas the dominant tt->lep+jets process cannot. It would be helpful to include this motivation in the ‘fit procedure’ section and perhaps also in the caption of Fig. 2.

169: Define a “bin” here, explicitly giving their sizes and the range of values to be used in the fit.

169-172: This sentence is quite long and would be improved by separating the signal strength definition into a shorter, self-contained sentence. Also, the present definition seems to suggest different signal strengths are considered for each bin of mT and lepton flavor (but are held in common for both signal categories?). You may break this into two sentences: one explicitly defining the signal strength used in the fit, and another detailing the categories, NPs, and so on.

173: This statement doesn’t seem strictly true, since the tau pT contributes to the missing-pT and thus the transverse mass.

185: How exactly do you treat the tt → tau_l tau_h bbbar background - it seems that this one should be discussed separately. In many aspects any measurement different from SM should also affect this background. E.g. If you measure a higher “signal” cross section, than this “signal” is also larger. If you observe anomalous tau coupling (as mentioned in l.13), than this process is even more affected.

193: Have you checked to quantify the “independence” of mT from the tau lepton pT? One could check the size of the effect by re-weighting the tau pT by the non-closure observed in Fig1 (~20% at high pt). (See also comment on L173)

196: Only changes to the normalization of the background templates are discussed here, but presumably the shapes are also allowed to vary (e.g. due to theory uncertainties).

200: To pass the signal selection, both the lepton and tau must be incorrectly identified. It would be helpful to state the dominant origin of these events (e.g. conversions, heavy flavor decays...)? The origin affects whether the fake contribution is expected to be charge-symmetric.

203-207: Is is unclear whether f_OS/SS is (A) a ratio of data events in OS and SS regions, or if it is (B) the double ratio comparing this quantity to the same one predicted by the MC. Put another way, does f_OS/SS=1 tell us that the same number of OS and SS events are expected, or that the ratio (which may NOT be 1) is well-described by the MC? L203 suggests (A), but ‘scale factor’ (L206) typically refers to data/MC comparisons suggesting (B). An explicit equation defining f_OS/SS would be useful here.

218: “is estimated to be” - how is it estimated?

224-228: After the 50% uncertainty on tau mis-ID is significantly constrained, are the mentioned differences in kinematic properties still covered? For example, does the profiled uncertainty cover data/MC differences in the reconstructed tau pT spectrum for a background-like selection? In Tab. 2 is this uncertainty included in the dominant “tau jet ID” entry? If so, it would be beneficial to separate them and explicitly show that the uncertainty is small. Otherwise it is hard to know whether to worry about the strong profiling. The sentence L227-228 calls it “not dominant” while the sentence L281-282 calls it “dominant”, so the situation here should be clarified.

236: Did you consider that the events in “standard” Z->ll are much cleaner than your events and the correction factors may be biased (in particular isolation related)? Did you check with MC events for instance?

237-238: Suggest removing the part of the sentence starting with “... selected by … ” (to the end of the sentence) - this is an unnecessary detail, and there is a reference anyway.

241-243: The sentence “The pileup is ...” seems to contradict lines 79-80. Either provide more details or follow similar wording (relying on the reference given).

247: In Fig.1 there is a trend towards softer-than-predicted tau leptons, of up to 20%. Does the trend persist after top pT re-weighting? If not, can you check the impact of re-weighting in tau lepton pT? (This could be done with the signal-rich selection, to disentangle effects from mis-identified taus.)

254: Theory uncertainties are also included in the extraction of the visible cross section presumably, so it is not clear why they are introduced here only in the context of the acceptance extrapolation. We suggest explicitly mentioning their effect on the visible cross section (a la L262-264) before describing each source of uncertainty.

257: State whether the scales are varied independently, coherently, or both. The determination of the uncertainty as the ‘envelope’ is clear for the case of the acceptance, but what is the treatment for the visible cross section extraction? Are shape variations considered for all combinations of scale choices, and how many nuisance parameters are included in the fit corresponding to the scale variations? Does the “ttbar ME” entry in Tab. 2 correspond to a combination of all renormalization, factorization, and hdamp scale variations?

264: The decision to ignore correlations here should be justified.

265: Are theory/shape uncertainties considered on the non-ttbar background?

265: Have you checked the dependence of the extracted cross section on the top mass assumption?

270 / Tab. 1: Regarding “The observed… expectation”, it is impossible to tell that the data/prediction agreement is good from the table, as the full uncertainties are not included. For example, the background muon channel shows a 4.2 sigma (!) discrepancy, just including the MC + data statistical uncertainties (and the difference is >2 sigma for 3 of 4 channels). The presentation here should be reconsidered, or an appropriate comment made in the text.

Fig. 3: In the first sentence of the caption, specify the e or mu lepton in the mT definition (i.e. the "lepton" is not the tau lepton).

277: It would be useful to include the post-fit normalization for each of the background processes here. (Have the post-fit estimates for these processes been cross-checked using orthogonal data selections, i.e. "validation regions"?) Also consider including a goodness-of-fit parameter (e.g. chi2/nDOF) to demonstrate the fit quality.

Table 1, caption, last sentence: Not clear what the meaning is : “uncertainty in … multijet contributions includes … uncertainty of the data … and … uncertainty of … THE OTHER processes.” (which other processes, what is the relation to multijets) Capitalize firsts words.

Tab. 2: Which process(es) does the “ME-PS matching” uncertainty correspond to? Matching schemes don’t appear to be described in the section describing MC samples.

Tab. 2: Suggest quoting the total uncertainty for each of the experimental, theoretical, and extrapolation categories.

288: Please add further explanation that the quoted cross sections here correspond to the full ttbar production process (not just the hadronic tau decay channels). The assumptions should be explicitly stated that allow you to extrapolate from e-tau_h and mu-tau_h decay channels to the full cross section (dividing by the SM branching fraction to those channels). Also consider instead reporting the cross section times branching ratio to each of the three channels, so that ell-tau_h is the sum of the other two channels.

288: Why are the electron and muon estimates so similar, considering the differences in acceptance and efficiency that have not been taken into account at this point (but are apparently included in the acceptance factor).

289-290: Here the acceptance seems to include all of the efficiencies in addition to the purely geometric acceptance effects. On one hand this suggests the visible cross-sections reported contain no efficiency corrections, limiting the use of these numbers. On the other hand, why is the acceptance defined to include efficiency - in this way the acceptance (generally a property of a physical process) becomes also a property of the detector and time, including its uncertainties? How is it possible that the acceptance as defined by you includes only “modeling” uncertainties but not efficiency uncertainties? It would improve the presentation if the efficiency factors for trigger, lepton and overall reconstruction are removed from the acceptance definition and treated as a separate correction, with a corresponding change to the visible cross section definition. Ideally the result would be cast as a limit on BR(top --> tau nu b) so that the various decay modes are properly correlated.

298: Exactly how have you constructed this ratio? Ref.7 explicitly mentioned that tau → lnunu are considered as signal, so any non-SM modification of your result with that result would be very correlated. This issue should be addressed in the discussion here.

299: As discussed above, anomalous tau production could also lead to a value or R consistent with the SM expectation (1.0).

306: “... includes the correlations… The estimate … 0.0071 (syst)...”. Your cross-section syst. error is 62/781 ~ 8% (last line on page 11). Then your table reports that most of the uncertainties are fully correlated with the ones in the dilepton channel. Yet for the ratio you arrive at 71/1050 ~ 7% systematic uncertainty which is about the same you started with, how come? How do you “include” the correlations?

320-321: The message of this sentence (“In the fit… tau lepton”) is unclear.

321: Taus from top decays were included through their fully-leptonic decays in previous measurements by both experiments at 13 TeV in the e-mu channel (e.g. https://arxiv.org/abs/1510.05302 and https://arxiv.org/abs/1606.02699). Suggest rephrasing to ‘requiring hadronic tau decays’ or similar.

## Physics comments (Type B)

 Abstract:

Why do you use () to present ttbar decay?

It would be nice to mention the result on lepton flavor universality in abstract too.

Event categories and fit procedure:

Its mentioned that events are grouped into two categories based on b-jet and trijet kinematic criteria in order to get better discrimination over the background. But it seems like the PLR fit is done in both categories. Is the final result extracted from both event category? If so, then how does this event categorization improve your result over no categorization?

Figure 3:

Looks like ttbar -> other is a huge background. I understand that you are constraining this background by the fit. But it would be nice to add some words on how that fitted output differs from MC prediction and how precise is the background uncertainty.

Line-by-line comments:

L8-9: No explanation or reference for the numbers 5/81 and 4/81.

L31: What is meant by distinct signature here?

L108: The factor 0.5 is used as a rule of thumb or there is any other explanation?

L110-112: This is a bit difficult to follow. It would better to rephrase rejected as selected or identified with inverting the Irel conditions as I guess these are the isolation conditions used for the electron or muon selection in the analysis. Then it would be relevant to L135. Also, you provide the misidentification probability in the following line, so sentence with selection or identification would be better.

L121: What is meant by hadron plus a strip/ two strip?

L128: This charge refers to the individual hadron or total tau charge?

L132: What is a generic hadronic jets?

L132: The misidentification rate is less than 1%. Could you please explain if this rate is so low, then how can ttbar lepton + jets where one jet is misidentified as tau jet be your dominant background (L181-183) and also could you provide a quantitative value of tau misidentification obtained from the fit as mentioned in L223?

L167-168: Could you explain how does this provide the additional constraint on the background?

L200: What are the other processes considered here?

L219: How is the charge uncertainty added to the identification uncertainty?

L249: Is this pT reweighting scale factor computed by the analyzers or taken from another source?

 Abstract:

"ttbar > (l nu_l)(tau_h nu_tau)bbbar" is a not a production process, but a decay. Rephrase, or at least add „pp> ttbar > (l nu_l)(tau_h nu_tau)bbbar“

In Introduction, Results and Summary three results are presented: cross section, R_(ltau_h/ll) and R_width, while the abstract only mentions two of them > suggest to add R_(ltau_h/ll) also to abstract

Introduction:

L7-9: The argument about the higher branching ratio for ttbar decays with at least one tau decay in the final state being higher compared to ee/mumu/emu does not really seem to be appropriate in the context of this analysis, since final state with two taus are not considered.

L27: What is meant by „complementing earlier measurements“?

Event simulation:

L61-80: Might consider having a table instead of the second paragraph as this would be easier to read.

L82: used for the estimation of the number of ttbar events in the simulation > used for the normalization of the number of ttbar events in simulation

L85: „The proton structure is described…“ It is not clear that this sentence refers to. Is it the cross section value? If yes, is it relevant to have this statement?

Event reconstruction and selection

L105: Can you add a motivation (or reference) for the choice of the definition of I_rel. In particular, why is there a factor 0.5 for E_ch^PU? The sentence on L108/109 is unclear. Please rephrase.

L111: are these standard cut values? If yes, add a reference.

L125: „Additional requirements…“ > it is not clear what this statement refers to as in the following there is only one additional requirement mentioned, namely the charge of the tau.

L127: „the signal cone“ has not been defined.

L136: can one of the two selected jets be the tau_h candidate or is a tau_h candidate required in addition to the two jets?

Event categories and fit procedure

L152 vs L155: the use of the term „two event categories“ is confusing in this section as it is both used to refer to the „e tau_h/mu tau_h“ categories and the „signal-like/background-like“ categories. Please review and rephrase.

L163: The statement of „less than two not b-tagged jets“ is not clear: This means zero or one not b-tagged jets? But zero is not possible, since there is always a tau_h candidate? Wouldn’t then „one not b-tagged jet“ be more appropriate?

L167: „maximization of yields in the two categories“: It is not clear what this refers to. e tau_h/mu tau_h or signal-like/background-like?

L167: „The categories proved an additional constrain“ > „Performing a simultaneous fit in two categories provides an additional constraint“ (or similar, it is not the „categories“ that provide the constraint, but the fact that you do the fit in two categories)

L173: What does it mean that „The fitted variables are not tied to the kinematic properties of the tau lepton“? > Rephrase

Background estimate

L203: Justify why f_OS/SS measured in the control region can also be applied in the signal region. Did you check this in simulation?

Systematical uncertainties

L224: Why is the misidentification probability varied around the expected value and not around the measured value?

L241: „The pileup is estimated…“ How is this information then used in your analysis to obtain a systematic uncertainty?

Results

L285: The definition of the visible cross section should be written explicitly. Are the isolation cuts included in the definition?

Before L288: In L286 it says „the visible cross section is defined in the fiducial region satisfying the kinematical cuts described earlier“. From this we understand that the pt cut is different for e and mu. How is sigma(l tau_h) then defined?

Before L296: State in the text how is sigma_tt (l tau_h) obtained from sigma_tt (e tau_h) and sigma_tt (mu tau_h)

L298: How are the correlations in systematic uncertainties treated when obtaining the ratio R_(ltau_h/ll)?

## Physics comments (Type B)

 (1) In the abstract you say twice that the cross section is measured, once for the hadronic tau final state and once for the inclusive production cross section. but in fact you only measure it in the fiducial phase space and then extrapolate it the full phase space based on acceptance taken from simulation. I think it is worthwhile to mention the fiducial measurement already in the abstract, since it is a selling point of this analysis.

(2) Why is the integrated luminosity 35.8 fb-1 instead of the more common value of 35.9 fb-1? Is it due to the chosen trigger paths?

%BLUE% >> It was an error with rounding, corrected it in the text and in the figures.

(3) I believe the description of the CMS detector is outdated, at least in conflicts with some mandatory statements from the twiki page.

(4) Whenever there is discussion about pileup, i.e. for the total inelastic pp cross section or the uncertainty on that, you cite Ref. 20. but this reference is for the ATLAS measurement of the pp cross section, which neither supports the nominal value used in CMS (69.2 mb), nor the uncertainty of 4.6% on that value when estimating the systematic uncertainty.

(5) Is it really necessary to quote the cuts on the electron isolation up to this many digits? I know, you were just copying it from the table in the twiki, but what relevance does this have to the reader (it might also trigger the question why the values for electron and muons differ and then you have to go into explaining that you actually select electrons based on the cut-based ID and so on ...)

(6) In the determination of the f_{OS/SS} scale factor, how large is the individual contribution of statistical uncertainty and the combined systematic uncertainties to the total uncertainty of 0.05?

(7) Is there any particular selection or ordering of the sources of uncertainties in the first paragraph of the systematic uncertainties section?

(8) What exactly is the 'p_T^miss scale' uncertainty? is it the propagation of the JES uncertainty to p_T^miss or are you referring to the unclustered energy uncertainty, which varies the energy of all unclustered particles in the determination of p_T^miss.

(9) The impact of a specific systematic uncertainties is evaluated by a likelihood scan and fixing all other nuisance parameters to their post-fit values. maybe clarify that you are referring to the post-fit values of the nominal fit results.

(10) Is there a good explanation why there is a significant impact for the jet energy resolution in both channel independently, but not in the combined result?

(11) What exactly is the 'ttbar background', 'Drell-Yan background', etc. uncertainty in Table 2? is it just a log normal nuisance parameter for the initial normalization? if so, please rephrase to 'ttbar background normalization'

%BLUE% >> The names correspond to the uncertainties in the TOP-17-001 measurement. Here, "ttbar background" corresponds to the tauh misidentification in other ttbar processes, "W+jets background" and "multijet background" include the normalization and the uncertainties of tauh misidentification.  "DY background" is only normalization. We can separate the tauh misidentification and normalization systematics.

Line-by-line comments:

- l.10: renewed interest in what, processes with tau leptons?

- l.23: speaking about the invariant mass between two objects is jargon, better refers to the invariant mass computed from the lepton momentum and p_T^miss.

%BLUE% >> Added.

- l. 71: I think, in at least some cases, Pythia 8.212 instead of 8.219 has been used, please check.

- l. 72: Tune CUETP8M2T4 has been only used for ttbar to improve the modeling in the jet multiplicity, all other processes are generated with Tune CUETP8M1, which was the default in 2016

- l.91: Please provide the version number of MCFM.

%BLUE% >> Added.

- l.111: although correct int he meaning, the sentence on l.111 'The electron candidate is considered to be non-isolated and is rejected if I_rel > 0.0588...' is in this construction hard to understand for uniformed reader. I suggest to rephrase it to something like 'Electron candidates with I_rel > ... are considered to be nonisolated and are rejected'

- l.111/112: a single candidate can be either in the barrel or the endcap, so: I_rel>0.0588 in the barrel *or*… “I_rel > 0.15 in *either( the barrel...

%BLUE% >> Corrected.

- l.194: determined separately ist misleading here, as (I assume) it is still the same fit in which the background normalizations are determined. It is also unclear if the normalizations are nuisance parameters with constraints or free fit parameters.

- l. 207: Which systematic uncertainties are considered for the scale factor? All uncertainty sources of Section 7 or only specific ones? Please provide a bit more information.

- l.209: the wording separate parameter is a little clearer, if you explain the role of these parameters in l.194

- l. 257: Did you avoid drastic muR, muF variations (i.e. 0.5,2.0 and 2.0,0.5)?

%BLUE% >> 

- Figure 1: please increase the width of the overflow bin to match the size of the remaining bins, otherwise you would also have to include horizontal error bars due to nonequidistant binning, also then y-axis label 'Events / X GeV'; align the 'lumi (sqrt(s))' to the right side (also for Figure 3) ; in my opinion the term 'lumped' in the caption is not very scientific (also for Figure 3); suggest tau_h p_T -> p_T(tau_h) (makes it more clear what the variable is and what the particle); shaded areas look very light when printed; colors for W+jets and diboson contributions look very similar when printed

- Figure 2: change the y axis label from 'a.u.' to a proper meaning, e.g. 'norm to unity' or 'probability density'; also include a overflow bin in this figure

- Figure 3: y axis label: use format "GeV>", uncertainty band is hard to see in printed version; caption 5th line (e tau_h) -> e not italic

- Figure 4: x axis label: cross section -> ttbar cross section; caption: describe what is actually shown here. It cannot be the likelihood, which should have a maximum at 800 pb. Is it the profile likelihood ratio, with the cross section profiled?

- Table 1 caption: suggest to clarify what of the other processes refers to, the processes that get subtracted from the data in the determination of the multijet shape

- Table 2: is 'sample size' in Table 2 simply the statistical uncertainty of the data set?; in Table 2,the experimental uncertainties seems to ordered according to their impact on the combined results. how is the ordering for the other categories chosen? ; also there is some inconsistency in Table 2 for the usage of abbreviations (ttbar, tW, ME, PS, ISR, FSR) and nonabbreviated terms (Drell-Yan, jet energy scale, jet energy resolution); is the last column just a yes/no, or the correlation factor that is assumed? In the latter case, 100% may be clearer than just 1, remove the vertical line

%BLUE% >> Yes, "sample size" is the statistical uncertainty. Other categories are ordered similar to the uncertainties in TOP-17-001 for easy comparison. THe last column is the correlation factor.

- l.269: do these categories refer to the definition of D_jjb in Section 5? If so: please refer to that section here

%BLUE% >> Yes. Added a reference.

- l.300: The extraction of R_\Gamma is not explained very clearly, and also the papers you refer to do not have the formulas that are needed explicitly. Why is R_\gamma not called the branching fraction B(t → tau nu_tau b)? It is not obvious, how R_\Gamma is computed

- l.323: is it possible to quantify by how much the previous measurements have been improved?

- l.328: maybe mention, which total width you are referring to: [...] the partial to the total top quark decay width [...]

%BLUE% >> Added.

- is reference 35 (muon performance at 7 TeV) really necessary, as you also quote reference 31 (muon performance at 13 TeV)?

%BLUE% >> Removed Ref.35.

- Is Reference 37 needed, when you are also using Reference 33 for the b-jet identification? If not, remove Ref. 37, as Ref. 33 is the most recent b tag paper.

%BLUE% >> Removed reference 37. It provides enough information about the b-tagging algorithm (CSVv2). And its' first citation if Ref.33.

- Ref. 35: Replace it with the Run 2 muon reconstruction and performance paper (JINST 13 (2018) P06015) 

%BLUE% >> Replaced.

## Physics (Type B)

 Type B (physics) comments:

I think that every use of "multijet" should be changed to "QCD multijet". I think that you are explicitly considering just QCD multijet so it should be made clear. For example, a W+jets event where the W decays to quarks can very reasonably be called a multijet event. I think that this is NOT included in your "simulation of multijet events" and is NOT included in your estimation of the multijet background because you use simulation to subtract out all of the non-QCD background. If I am mistaken, then this should be clarified.

%BLUE% >>

L7-9: I don't see the point of this sentence. Why compare the branching ratio with the light dilepton? If you are trying to make the case that you can expect more events, this is obviously not true for two reasons. First, your analysis only considers hadronically decaying taus so only 65% of the 5/81 are targeted. Also, the tau_h efficiency is much lower than the muon and electron efficiencies. So it seems disingenous to point out that the tau BR is higher when there are important factors you don't mention here. Suggest removing the sentence.

%BLUE% >> Removed it.

L13-14: Is the new physics t-> H^+b -> tau nu b? I would suggest explicitly writing this. Given this justification, is there any way to use your final results to set a limiton new physics contributions?

%BLUE% >>

L23-4, L152: The way these two sentences are worded, I initially understood that the two event categories referred to muons and electrons. It wasn't until ~L169 that I figured out what the two event categories meant. Here are some possible solutions. For L23-4: "The cross section is measured from a profile likelihood ratio (PLR) fit of four transverse mass distributions, corresponding to a division by the lepton final state (electron or muon) and kinematic properties of the jets (signal-like or background-like)." Note that missing transvsere momentum has not yet been defined so defining the transvsere mass in terms of this quantity is problematic. One could also remove the sentence entirely. For L152: "...PLR fit [34] of four binned distributions of the transverse mass of the light-lepton and \ptmiss corresponding to a division by the lepton flavor (electron or muon) and by a division of the events into signal-like and background-like event categories." One could also move the first two sentences to the end of Section 5. This may make more sense since at the end you will have fully defined the event categories.

%BLUE% >>

L70, L90: You generate QCD events with MG5_aMC@NLO but then normalize to results from Pythia8. Why? Both are LO but I would tend to trust the MadGraph results more than the Pythia ones. Do they give different results?

%BLUE% >> It is a mistake, QCD simulation is normalized to the cross section from MG5_aMC@NLO.
But the QCD simulation is used only in the Analysis Note to verify the data-based method for QCD estimation.
The paper does not mention the QCD simulation, therefore we have removed these lines.

L106: I suspect that E_ch is composed just of tracks that originate from the primary vertex, while E_nh and E_ph are composed of all neutral particles. That is the only way the I_rel equation makes sense to me. If so, I think this information needs to be included. One would need to add text about how the primary vertex is selected (likely in the previous paragraph) and rewrite this sentence to make it clear how E_ch, E_nh, and E_ph are calculated.

%BLUE% >> Added the sentence about the primary vertex in the previous paragraph.
TODO: tracks/all particles?

Figures 1 and 3: - The colors assigned for single top and W+jets are nearly indistinguishable. This does not work since they are adjacent. You could swap the colors of single top and ttbar->other to make it easy to distinguish. - Why do you change colors for the electron and muon signal channels? You don't change any of the background colors even though they also have different leptons in them. I would suggest using the same color for both. - In the signal legend for the muon mode has a problem. The subscript muon for the muon neutrino is spaced strangely. The tau subscript seems fine so I don't think it is an issue for all Greek letters. Can you see about fixing it? One alternative to simplify things is to remove the subscripts on all of the neutrinos or even remove the neutrinos entirely.

%BLUE% >>

Suggest switching the order of Sections 5 and 6. It seems like Section 6 provides a good motivation for Section 5. One might even move Section 5 to after Section 7. Here are some issues it resolves. - Currently, L156-158 (Section 5) mentions a background from "misidentified tau_h from the ttbar lepton+jets process" but it is not explained how this is a background. In L182-3 (Section 6) it is clarified that a jet fakes a tau_h. - In L191-193 (Section 6) a justification is given for using M_T. This justification would seem to be more natural if it occurs before stating that M_T is used in the fit (Section 5). Note that a switch to the order would require changing where M_T is defined and maybe some other minor changes. If this is not done, then the two issues above should still be addressed.

%BLUE% >>

L156-168: The text here needs to better explain and justify what is done. Some specific suggestions: - L157-8: I don't think it is correct to say that constraints are used. I would suggest that kinematic features are used. When people talk about constraints with the top quark and W boson mass, I assume they are talking about actually setting quantities equal to these masses, usually to obtain the neutrino momentum. - It would be very useful to show a plot of D_jjb or D^min_jjb for signal and background (ttbar lepton+jets) events so that one can see there is a difference and a cut at 60 GeV is reasonable. I think this plot would be much more useful than Figure 4 (which seems pointless) and at least as useful as Figure 2 (which is redundant with Figure 3). - Can you quantify the improvement in the analysis by splitting into two event categories? This could be an all MC study or fitting the data with a simplified fit putting all events into the same category. Does the total uncertainty improve? If so, by how much? I think this would be useful to add to the text to justify the event category splitting (assuming the uncertainty does, in fact, improve).

%BLUE% >>

%BLUE% The event categories based on kinematic parameters of jets serve as independent constraint in addition to the MT shape. In an older MC study we saw that typically the misidentification uncertainty is reduced: from 25%, without categories and without a shape fit, to 5% with only categories, to 2.5% with the shape, and to 2% with the categories and the shape.

L173-4: I have no idea what this sentence means. The only fitted variable is M_T, right? So are you saying that M_T is independent of the tau kinematics? Is this the same information as given in L192-193?

%BLUE% >> Yes, only M_T is fitted, it is independed from tau kinematics and the kinematics of misidentified taus.
This information is the same, but it is considered in two different contexts:
in the discussion of the fit at L173-4 we notice that the fit is model-independent with respect to the tau branch of the decay;
in L192-193 we discuss how it works to constrain the uncertainty about the probability to misidentify taus.

L187: Does "lepton identification" correspond to both light leptons and tau leptons? Does it imply both efficiency and misidentification rate? Needs to be clarified in the text.

%BLUE% >> It corresponds to the identification efficiency of electrons and muons. The misidentification rate is negligibly small. The identification of tau leptons corresponds to the "tauh jet identification" uncertainty.

L190-196: I do not understand the point of this paragraph and I am confused by it. I think the point of the paragraph is that, in contrast to the quantities described in L187-8, the tau_h misidentification rate is extracted from the fit to the data. Is that right? But then in L224-227, it seems like the misidentification probability is an input with a 50% uncertainty. This sentence also mentions differences between the expected and observed misidentification probability. Is the expected simulation and the observed data? Is the data the same sample you are using or something else? Like I said, I am very confused. I think that L190-6 and L223-228 should be rewritten. Some other questions/comments. Are you simply putting in the tau_h misid rate as a nuisance and the post-fit uncertainty is much smaller than the pre-fit uncertainty? Is that what you mean by measuring it in the fit? Is it implemented any different than the trigger efficiency, lepton ID efficiency, JER, etc.?

%BLUE% >> The uncertainties in the quantities in L187-8 are measured in seprate studies. We use them as an external input for our measurement. But the uncertainty in the tau misidentification probability (L190-96) is handled within our measurement, for our particular event selection, because it depends significantly on the kind of jets selected in the events. The uncertainty of tau misidentification enters the fit with large variation of +-50% from the expected value in MC. This variation covers the usual Data-MC disagreement in the tau misidentification probability, which is on order of 20-30%. The more conservative 50% also cover possible effects from the dependence of the misidentification probability on the kinematic parameters of fake taus. The reduction of the pre-fit variation to 20% changes the overall uncertainty by about 0.1%. Therefore we have decided to use the more conservative magnitude of the variation. The fit constrains the pre-fit misidentification probability giving the post-fit "observed" misidentification probability and the variation of the misidentification probability, which we shortly descrive as "to measure in the fit". L224 "the misidentification probability is varied within +-50% of the expected values" -- the "expected values" are the values in MC. The nuisance parameters can vary either just the number of events expected in a process or also the shape of the distribution in the process. Tau misidentification probability varies just the number of events. The trigger efficiency, lepton ID efficiency, JER have effect of the shape of MT distribution. Therefore in the fit they are included as "shape" variations, i.e. they vary both the number of events and the shape of the distribution.

L228, L281-2, Table 2: This is related to the above. In L228 it is stated that tau_h misid is NOT the dominant uncertainty. In L281-2 it is stated that tau_h identification and misidentification is one of the dominant experimental uncertainties. In Table 2 it appears that these two systematic uncertainties are combined into one value called tau_h jet identification. Is that correct? If tau_h misid is truly measured in the fit, then there should be a separate nuisance for it. So why don't you have separate lines in Table 2 for efficiency and misid rate? If you can add this, please do. Hopefully it will show that the efficiency is ~4.5% and the misid rate is much less. Then, you can be more precise about the dominant experimental uncertainties as being just the tau_h identification efficiency and the statement in L228 will not be in doubt.

%BLUE% >> In L228 we notice that the uncertainty from the misidentification is radically constrained, instead of 10-20% we get about 2.5% in the final result (listed in Table 2 as "ttbar background"). It is still one of the largest uncertainties in the final result. But it is noticeably smaller than the uncertainty in tau ID, and it is on the same level as the other large uncertainties (pileup and modeling).

%BLUE% In the Table 2 the misidentification uncertainty is embedded in the uncertainty of the background process which produces the fake taus: "ttbar background", "W+jets background" and "multijet background". We chose this representation of nuisances to correspond to the measurement in dilepton final state (TOP-17-001), which is used in the estimation of the ratio between two final states. However, since these systematics are not correlated in the two measurements, we can split them into separate lines.

%BLUE% Corrected L281-2 to use "the largest experimental/theoretical uncertainties" insted of "the dominant".

Figure 2: It would be useful to have the processes in the legend. So, "signal" could be "Signal: ttbar -> l nu tau_h nu b bbar" and "background" could be "Background: ttbar -> l nu q qbar' b bbar". It would also be good to have an overflow bin as in Figure 3 (or simply include the overflow in the last bin from 160-250). If the overflow bin is added, the information needs to be added to the caption.

%BLUE% >>







L217: You write that a 5% uncertainty is applied to all processes with a true tau_h. Is this really by process and not by event? I can imagine there are some W+jets with a true tau_h and without a true tau_h. So do you apply the 5% to all events in this sample, regardless of whether there is an actual tau_h in the acceptance? If so, then I think you need to specify which processes get the 5% uncertainty. If, in fact, you apply this based on each event, you need to reword the sentence accordingly.

%BLUE% >> The sub-processes, like W+jets with true tau_h or DY with tau_h, are handled separately. So, effectively it is applied on per-event basis. In the paper we present inclusive contributions of these processes (in the Table of event yields and in the Figures) to keep the focus of the reader on main factors in the measurement.

L244-247: It is not clear how these uncertainties are actually incorporated.

%BLUE% >> They are implemented with per-event weights and corresponding shape templates. Corrected the paragraph to state it clearly.

L275-277: I don't think this paragraph or Figure 4 add anything useful to the paper. It also seems weird that the first time we can figure out the result is by reading off this plot and the number only appears in print much later. You could replace the paragraph with a sentence that simply states that separate fits are performed to the electron channel, muon channel, and combined channel. If you keep it, please specify that the "cross section" in L276 is the full phase space cross section.

%BLUE% >> Rephrased and moved this paragraph to the discussion of the results at the end of the section.

Table 2: What does "sample size" mean? Is this the same as the statistical uncertainty that appears in the results? If so, then the Table 2 caption is not quite accurate as it says these are the systematic uncertainties. You could change the caption to "Systematic and statistical uncertainties" or else remove the line from the table.

%BLUE% >> Yes, it is the statistical uncertainty in the measurement.

L294-5: Is it true that the uncertainties for the full phase space are obtained by simple error propagation of the visible phase space and the acceptance uncertainties assuming no correlation? I tried it and I get uncertainties that are larger than what is reported. Can you check these numbers (with full precision) to be sure they are accurate. If it is not simple error propagation, should I be able to understand what is done from what is written in the paper?

%BLUE% >> TODO: 1) the rounding is important here, 2) there is an error in final result in eltau 789.34024 [11.05076336 70.5550516962668 19.733506000000002] -- the systematic must be 71, 3) there is an error in the estimation of uncertainties in the fiducial xsec, it is a relative uncertainty and the cross section values must be calculated w.r.t the fitted fiducial xsec, but they are calculated w.r.t expected fiducial xsec. However, it seems the 3) does not propagate to the full xsec.

L296: The scale uncertainty shows a large asymmetry which doesn't seem to be reflected in the scale uncertainties in Table 2. Is this consistent?

%BLUE% >>

L320-1: I don't understand what this sentence is saying or why it needs to be stated. Can it be removed? 

%BLUE% >> It notifies that the construction of the fit is model-independent with respect to the tau branch of the ttbar decay.



### corrections

Figure 2: It would be useful to have the processes in the legend. So, "signal" could be "Signal: ttbar -> l nu tau_h nu b bbar" and "background" could be "Background: ttbar -> l nu q qbar' b bbar". It would also be good to have an overflow bin as in Figure 3 (or simply include the overflow in the last bin from 160-250). If the overflow bin is added, the information needs to be added to the caption.

Congratulations on completing the dilepton tt¯ cross section measurement in the τ

channel and a well-written paper! Please, find my detailed comments below, split in the physics and style categories.

## PHYSICS COMMENTS:

- LL7-9: the comparison is not very fair, as once you take into account the τ→τh
branching fraction and the fact that you exclude decays into two τ's, the advantage is completely erased.
I'd therefore drop this sentence altogether.

%BLUE% >> Removed.

- LL10-11: first of all, here you should really do the proper referencing of the R (D/D∗) measurements,
which come from LHCb, BaBar, and Belle, not just LHCb.
Similarly, you should cite all three R(K/K∗) LHCb papers, not just the last one.
Finally, the text doesn't read well as is; suggest rephrasing it as follows:
"Recent hints of lepton flavour universality violation [xx-yy] sparked a renewed interest to measurements involving τ leptons. The t→(τντ)b decay ..."

%BLUE% >> Added a citation to a recent review paper. TODO: add the papers from experiments.
Corrected the text.

- L18: the absolute majority of our 2016 data papers cite an integrated luminosity of 35.9 fb−1;
why your uses only 35.8 fb−1 despite being based on standard single-lepton triggers that were exposed to full integrated luminosity?

%BLUE% >> It is a mistake in the rounding (35.86). It was also noticed in the PAS and corrected for the future update of the paper.

- L25 and further in the paper: the standard notation for "visible cross section" is "fiducial cross section", and it's used by theorists and ATLAS. I strongly suggest switching to this terms throughout the paper [see also detailed style comments]: "... in the fiducial and full phase space are performed."

%BLUE% >> Corrected.

- LL33-34: the sentence is not quite accurate as you do not include light leptons from τ
lepton decays in the definition of signal, but you account for those in the background.
Suggest modifying the sentence saying exactly that.

%BLUE% >> Corrected.

- L55: give a  reference to our recent trigger paper here.

%BLUE% >> Added (Khachatryan:2016bia 1609.02366).

- L91: give the MCFM version here (7.0 ?).

%BLUE% >> Yes, added.

- LL100-101: are you sure that the b tagging discriminators use PF objects, and not directly tracks? Please, double-check.

%BLUE% >> The CSV discriminator uses the tracks associated with the jet clustered from PF objects and the SV of the jet.
Moved b tagging discriminators to a separate sentence:
"Parameters of jets and the tracks associated with jets provide input variables for \cPqb tagging discriminators."

- LL113-114: the muon charge misidentification rate can't be measured with the Z(μμ) events in data as if the charged is misidentified, it's almost guaranteed that the momentum is grossly mismeasured and therefore the event is not within the Z peak any longer; the muon misidentification rate is therefore determined from Z(μμ) simulation, unlike the electron one. Please, correct the sentence.

%BLUE% >> Corrected.

- L131: give a reference to our first W/Z cross section paper for the tag-and-probe method.

- Figures 1, 3: single top -> single t [or single top quark] in the legends.

%BLUE% >> Corrected, "single top quark" everywhere.

- L161: cite the PDG here.

%BLUE% >> Added the citation.

- LL207-208: drop "within statistical uncertainties" - you already gave the number with the uncertainties and claimed that it's consistent with the expectation from simulation, which is self-explanatory.

# Thomas' fixes

1. DONE Check the main corrections -- are there any more questionable ones?
2. DONE Apply the rest on the branch.
3. DONE Make the diff pdf.


## Good points

using mT instead of MT
modelling instead of modeling

"is used to estimate" instead of "is used for the estimation of"

subdetectors instead of sub-detectors

substitute Opposite Sign (OS) by Opposite Charge (OC)
and Same Sign (SS) to Same Charge (SC)

branching fractions instead of branching ratios


## Questionable corrections

abstract "remove 2016 by":
collected in 2016 by the CMS detector
->
collected in the CMS detector

L19, replace “and it” with “, which”; delete “relative”; and replace “with respect” by “relative”.

%BLUE% >> Here we are trying to stress that we compare the relative precision of our measurement with the relative precisions in 7 and 8 TeV.
We have had misunderstandings in the comparisons of the absolute and relative precisions.
And we would like to keep "improves the relative precision with respect to 7 and 8 TeV" to make the point clear.

L19, replace “and it” with “, which”; delete “relative”; and replace “with respect” by “relative”.

-- replacing "and it" does not make sense:
"The measurement is extended to a higher energy and it improves"
->
"The measurement is extended to a higher energy, which improves"

-- the higher energy does not improve the precision, the new measurement method does

L22, replace “by performing” with “through a fit to”; put profile into quotation marks: “profile”; and replace “fit of” with “[Ref. for PLR] to”.

-- this way we get "the cross section is measured through a fit to a 'profile' likelihood ratio (PLR) to the transverse mass..."
I am not sure this is correct.

L319, replace “, in” with “system in our”; delete “according”.

-- this way we get
"The background is constrained ... in our two event categories, constructed according to the kinematic properties of the jets..."
->
"The background is constrained ... in our two event categories, according to the kinematic properties of the jets..."

which seems wrong.



## The main body of corrections

### Questionable

L58 The analysis makes use of simulated samples of tt events as well as other processes that result in τ leptons in the final state.

-- does not make sense to remove "samples of tt"

L59 "used to design the event selection, to calculate the acceptance..."
--> "used to design the event selections to calculate the acceptance..."

L100 "of the transverse momenta of any or all reconstructed particles," -- what is "any or all"?

L105 "pT_{ch}" insted of "E_{ch}" -- it is a definition, and it uses E? -- No! we use ET, so change it for pT

L138 substitute Opposite Sign (OS) by Opposite Charge (OC)

L143 endcaps -> end sectors, but at L112 endcaps -> end detectors

L186 "All processes, except multijet, are estimated from simulation"
-> "All, except multijet, events are estimated from simulation"

L191 "misidentification is determined...as a funtion of mT" -- it is not a function of mT, it is orthogonal to mT, that is why we can estimate it as a normalization parameter!

Figure 2: change the X and Y axes titles?

L253-254 "is extrapolated...by correcting the acceptance of the signal in ttbar data"???

L254 "acceptance includes the modelling of uncertainties" -- is this correct?

Table 1 "capitalize first letters of each set of words"
-- then the table will disagree with the text and the legends in figures

L267 (first sentece of "Results") using "number of events" instead of "event yields"?

L277 "<The observed and expected NLL>...in the e-tauh and mu-tauh final states combined are shown"
-> "... final states are shown combined"?

using "change" instead of "variation" for systematic uncertainties?

saying "fit to PLR" instead of "PLR fit"?


## The diff script

The `latexdiff` is complicated, it plugs many different commands to marks the changes in the text.
These commands are not standard, therefore special packages must be included in the CMS tdr system
to process them. More than that, they have some not trivial syntaxis and are not simply grep-able.

    latexdiff versions_TOP-18-005_CADI-BuildTag_2019-07-27_08-54-14.tex TOP-18-005.tex > TOP-18-005_revision_latexdiff.tex

The unified `diff` is much simpler and can work.
The only downside is it marks the whole line where a change appeared.

    diff -U 2000 versions_TOP-18-005_CADI-BuildTag_2019-07-27_08-54-14.tex TOP-18-005.tex > TOP-18-005_revision_diff-u.tex


Remove the first character space:

    :% s,^ ,,

Remove the differences in comments:

    :% s,^[+-][ \t]*%,%,

Clear up the comments:

    :% s,\([^\\]\{3}\)%,\1\r%,

Add the closing braces:

    :% g/^[-+]/ s/$/}/

Insert the openings:

    :% s,^-,\\textcolor{red}{,
    :% s,^+,\\textcolor{blue}{,

comments are a big problem

# remaining questions TODO:

from Albert De Roeck

DONE
- line 90 Why is the multi-jet simulation normalised to Pythia? Surely Madgraph has its
    own normalisation. Is that one not ok?
    If that is done for a physics reason it may be useful to spell that out
    in 1/2 sentence here.

%BLUE% >> Indeed, the normalization comes from the generator, ie Madgraph, as discussed on [[https://twiki.cern.ch/twiki/bin/viewauth/CMS/SummaryTable1G25ns#QCD][the summary]] and [[https://twiki.cern.ch/twiki/bin/view/CMS/HowToGenXSecAnalyzer][the tool]] twikies, and also [[https://hypernews.cern.ch/HyperNews/CMS/get/susy-interpretations/196/1/1/1.html][in this thread]].
The sentence was just forgotten because the simulated multijet events are not mentioned in the paper.
The simulated multijet events are used only for the verification of the data-driven method in the Analysis Note.
Therefore, I remove this line about the normalization of MC multijet altogether.

DONE
- line 200: Using the "same charge" sample: is that a good background estimator? We have a non-negligable charge misidentification, ie real signal event that will end up as an (SS) event. What is the contamination of real events, which became SS, compared to the total you select for this background estimator? if small then it is ok of course. 

%BLUE% >> In the SS selection the signal events comprize about 4.5% of events. But the effect of the signal events on the extraction of the QCD contribution is smaller than that, because the shapes of QCD and the signal are different.
The distribution of QCD events is concentrated at lower values of the transverse mass, up to 100GeV (150GeV) in muon-tau (electron-tau) final state.
And the signal is more smeared across the spectrum, with a peak at about 80-90GeV.
More specifically, in the Same Sign muon-tau selection the fraction of signal events is about 3-4% in the mT bins up to 80 GeV.
And the fraction of QCD events is about 10%.
Therefore, the variation of the signal contribution due to the uncertainty in the tauh charge misidentification does not affect significantly the shape of the QCD estimated in the Same Sign selection.

in principle, the good part is that QCD and signal are in different parts of the mT distribution.

%BLUE% >> Indeed, the normalization comes from the generator, ie Madgraph, as discussed on [[https://twiki.cern.ch/twiki/bin/viewauth/CMS/SummaryTable1G25ns#QCD][the summary]] and [[https://twiki.cern.ch/twiki/bin/view/CMS/HowToGenXSecAnalyzer][the tool]] twikies, and also [[https://hypernews.cern.ch/HyperNews/CMS/get/susy-interpretations/196/1/1/1.html][in this thread]].
The sentence was just forgotten because the simulated multijet events are not mentioned in the paper.
The simulated multijet events are used only for the verification of the data-driven method in the Analysis Note.
Therefore, I remove this line about the normalization of MC multijet altogether.

DONE
Table 1  please, add  contribution from tt -> (tau_l nu_tau) (tau_h nu_tau) b b_bar as a separate line

%BLUE% >> We would like to avoid adding a separate line for this final state in the table in order to keep the table in sync with the figures.





From Thomas:

And I must confess that L252--265 seem somewnat crazy!
You are not "varying" anything when you make the changes by the specified factors.
I think I understand what you mean, but not because you have been helpful.
You repeat the old ways this has been stated in the past, which I find very much wanting.

TODO: this ^^^

And I hope that you can make your results quantitatively clearer in the Summary – e.g., by stating things in terms of how much you have improved on previous measurements.
Finally, you keep talking about cross sections and ratios of widths, but you often seem to not maintain clarity what these widths and cross sections mean. For example, the mu, e, and ell values can be similar only if ell is either mu or e, or the mean of mu and e. And you don't specify which widths you are discussing. I am not sure if the “total” width is that of the top quark or that for all the dileptons states? And also I am not sure whether you have identified the 781pb with the total t\tbar cross section (all channels).

TODO: this ^^^



DONE: do not forget to change mT in figures!




# CWR comment from Thomas Ferbel   (https://cds.cern.ch/record/2684836)

You seem often to be tripping over your own words, and thereby writing things difficult to follow. Some places contain extra, unneeded words. Several symbols appear to be from a previous generation of usage, which indicates that the authors and the CLE have not looked at a recent version of our PubCom guidelines. I hope to have caught most of your transgressions in our standard nomenclature, and trust that my corrections will be entered into the text with care. 

We no longer use a dot to signify multiplication but recommend using nothing or \times if that is essential; we now use the symbols pT and no longer those such as ET; we also recommend the use of "subdetector", "nonisolated" and "semileptonic" and not their hyphenated spellings. In addition, our terms for any mass usually use a lower-case m, thus transverse mass would be written as mT and not as MT. We don’t use branching “ratio” but “fraction”. Since you seem to have chosen UK English as your writing style, be aware that you should use "modelling" and not "modeling" in your draft. And I must confess that L252--265 seem somewnat crazy! You are not "varying" anything when you make the changes by the specified factors. I think I understand what you mean, but not because you have been helpful. You repeat the old ways this has been stated in the past, which I find very much wanting. Your term "visible" should be changed to "fiducial", as there is nothing visible about it. Why do you add the extra "al" to "kinematic" and "systematic"? And I hope that you can make your results quantitatively clearer in the Summary – e.g., by stating things in terms of how much you have improved on previous measurements.

Nevertheless, you have put together an excellent analysis, and presented the reader with a manuscript that can be fixed without much trouble. Of course, you may not agree with my recommendations, but I urge you not to reject them out of hand and check with your colleagues about my changes. Also check out my comments on the captions and figures. 

I have added below in .doc format questions for sections that are usually discussed at the FR, but I provide recommendations for the entire draft using standard Adobe Acrobat tools for editing PDF files. Hope that you can consider both possibilities.

DONE
Table 1  please, add  contribution from tt -> (tau_l nu_tau) (tau_h nu_tau) b b_bar as a separate line




Please, find below comments of Type B.

lines 8-9  I do not understand 5/81 and 4/81. I understand 5 (etau, mutau,
taue, taumu, tautau), but what is 81 ? The total number of ll' combinations
is 9, no ?

%BLUE% >> Indeed, we could just focus on the combinatorics between leptons and the comparison between final states with taus and without.
But in order to provide a context to the reader we consider all W decays, their "naive" branching fractions: 1/9 for each leptonic final state and 6/9 for the quark final states.

lines 13-14  There are both CMS and ATLS H+ -> tau nu analyses with 13 TeV, 2016 data. Why do not cite them at this point ?

%BLUE% >> In order to avoid detailed overview of the results of the searches in various final states, we limited the references to the theory and phenomenology of the charged Higgs.
I've added two references to the recent searches of H+->tau nu.


line 23 add after lepton "(electron or muon)", othrwise one could think about tau lepton (tau_h)

%BLUE% >> Added.

lines 24-25 one can not measure "directly"  cross-section in the "full space". You measure the visible cross-section and go to the total cross-section using MC.

%BLUE% >> Corrected.

line 81 mention that this tt~ cross-section is for mt = 172.5 GeV if it is the case.

%BLUE% >> Added.

line 89-90 QCD multijet events were generated with aMC@NLO. What is the reason to normalize it on PYTHIA8 LO
cross-section ?

%BLUE% >> Indeed, the normalization comes from the generator, ie Madgraph, as discussed on [[https://twiki.cern.ch/twiki/bin/viewauth/CMS/SummaryTable1G25ns#QCD][the summary]] and [[https://twiki.cern.ch/twiki/bin/view/CMS/HowToGenXSecAnalyzer][the tool]] twikies, and also [[https://hypernews.cern.ch/HyperNews/CMS/get/susy-interpretations/196/1/1/1.html][in this thread]].
The sentence was just forgotten because the simulated multijet events are not mentioned in the paper.
The simulated multijet events are used only for the verification of the data-driven method in the Analysis Note.
Therefore, I remove this line about the normalization of MC multijet altogether.

line 97  Please replace "produced in the collision" by "in the event".  For example brem. photons or e+e- from
gamma conversions are not produced in the pp collision, but produced after that in the tracker material.

%BLUE% >> Corrected.

In Section 6 it is not quite clear about background evaluation from the fit. Do you use the normalization and shapes
from MC (except QCD) and you vary normalization within uncertainties in the fit ? If yes, mention it more clear.

%BLUE% >> Added an explanation.




line 223  I do not undertand this sentence about the measurement of tau missID from the fit. Is this 50 % uncertainty
value recommended in tau ID paper at 13 TeV that you have cited ?

%BLUE% >> The tau ID paper does not recommend a specific treatment of misidentified taus, but it demonstrates the typical behaviour of the misidentification in several selections of events.
In these selections the Data-MC disagreement for the misidentification probability varies around 20-30%, depending on pT, eta and the kind of jets you have in the given selection.
So, the pre-fit variation of 50% is a conservative value. But reducing it to 20% reduces the overal uncertainty by only about 0.1%.
Therefore, we have decided to stick with the conservative magnitude of the prefit variation.
Also, we had considered using a free parameter for the tau misidentification in the fit, but discarded it due to issues in the fitting software.

Line 282-284  I do not understand this sentence "The effect of these uncertainties on final state objects ..."
How QCD scale and PDF uncertainty can make an effect on the final state objects like jet, muon, electron ?

%BLUE% >> It still can affect their kinematic distribution within the fiducial space of the detector.

Table 1  please, add  contribution from tt -> (tau_l nu_tau) (tau_h nu_tau) b b_bar as a separate line

%BLUE% >> We would like to avoid adding a separate line for this final state in the table in order to keep the table in sync with the figures.

line 289  Does acceptance A include BR (W->tau nu) ? It looks like it is, since you get the total cross-section
as sigma_tot = sigma_vis / A.  In that sence I do not understand R_gamma evaluation (line 301). You just multiply your sigma_tot
by BR(W->tau nu).

%BLUE% >> The BR(W->tau nu) is included in the fiducial cross section, the acceptance is just the fraction of signal events passing in the fiducial space of the detector.
Indeed, R_gamma is calculated with sigma_tot multiplied by BR(W->tau nu), which cancels out the BR(W->tau nu) included in the sigma_tot.
Therefore, R_gamma includes only the BR(W-> e/mu) that is included in the measurement in dilepton channels.

# CWR comment from Albert De Roeck (https://cds.cern.ch/record/2684497)

 - line 27: "complementing earlier measurements". You mean complementary in the sense that
   we are the first measurement of this channel at 13 TeV? For the ratios I assume our 
   measurements are more precise than eg the ATLAS ones or our own CMS ones at 7 and 8 
   TeV? If so I believe we are underselling the value of work in this paper.  
   I did not check by how much we actually improve the 
   precision here but we could comment on that in the results section.
   I have the same comment for line 309/310 where we use the same phrasing.

%BLUE% >> Changed it to "expanding earlier measurements in terms of precision and centre of mass energy of collisions."
The relative precision is improved by about 1.5% with respect to the measurements from hadron colliders (CDF and ATLAS):
from slightly more than 8% in the result by ATLAS, to slightly less than 7% in our measurement.
Since the uncertainty is still of the same order of magnitude, and also the results from LEP have much higher precision (3%),
we decided to avoid a discussion of the improvement of the precision.

- line 74: Traditionally we give (for the record here) also the matching schemes used
    ie MLM/FXFX../ as appropriate. This sounds trivial but there are other options, 
    so it is good to keep the tradition to keep mentioning them... so we remember in
    some years from now.  :)

%BLUE% >> Specified and added citations.

- line 90 Why is the multi-jet simulation normalised to Pythia? Surely Madgraph has its 
    own normalisation. Is that one not ok?
    If that is done for a physics reason it may be useful to spell that out 
    in 1/2 sentence here.

%BLUE% >> Indeed, the normalization comes from the generator, ie Madgraph, as discussed on [[https://twiki.cern.ch/twiki/bin/viewauth/CMS/SummaryTable1G25ns#QCD][the summary]] and [[https://twiki.cern.ch/twiki/bin/view/CMS/HowToGenXSecAnalyzer][the tool]] twikies, and also [[https://hypernews.cern.ch/HyperNews/CMS/get/susy-interpretations/196/1/1/1.html][in this thread]].
The sentence was just forgotten because the simulated multijet events are not mentioned in the paper.
The simulated multijet events are used only for the verification of the data-driven method in the Analysis Note.
Therefore, I remove this line about the normalization of MC multijet altogether.

- line 104: Do we require the leptons to come from the primary vertex. Please say that in   
    the text

%BLUE% >> Added the sentence on PV in previous paragraph and mentioned that leptons must originate from PV.

- line 104: ...And somewhere before we should define the primary vertex anyway, eg in the 
    paragraph just above this one?

%BLUE% >> Added the sentence on PV.

- line 106 E_CH: These hadron are required to come from the primary vertex right?
     (add that, and the primary vertex definition as requested above)

%BLUE% >> Yes, corrected.

- line 125: It is not clear to the non-CMS reader here what lifetime information you mean 
   and where does it come from (detector or information-wise), from the discussion so far. 

%BLUE% >> Added an explanation.








- line 140: the pseudo-rapidity variable was already introduced in line 47.

%BLUE% >> I have moved the definition of DeltaR up, to the "E_CH is ... deposited ... within a cone of $\Delta R = \sqrt{(\Delta\varphi)^2 + (\Delta\eta)^2} = 0.4$".
And skipped the explanation of the phi and the pseudo-rapidity here, since they are described in the description of the detector, at line 47.

- line 162: So the two categories are a 'signal-like' and a 'background-like' category,
    right? I somehow did not find that 100% clear, but this is how I interpreted the text.  
    If that is wrong, it needs more clarification.

%BLUE% >> This is correct. I have added quotation marks, which should make it clear:
"The event is assigned to the ``signal-like'' category if..." and "Otherwise, it is assigned to the ``background-like'' event category."
In the following I use these names without the quotation marks.

- line 200: Using the "same charge" sample: is that a good background estimator?
    We have a non-negligable charge misidentification, ie real signal event that will end
    up as an (SS) event. 
    What is the contamination of real events, which became SS, compared to the 
    total you select for this background estimator? if small then it is ok of course.

%BLUE% >> 

- reference 38 This is pointing to a paper for JES corrections 8 TeV/run-1. We do 
    not have a reference for the 13 TeV data yet?  I thought I saw that being used in 
    other papers already. please check.

%BLUE% >> I am afraid the 8 TeV reference is correct, since it correcponds to [[https://hypernews.cern.ch/HyperNews/CMS/get/jes/648/1/1/1.html][Summer16 corrections which were used]].
We decided to stick with the original 2016 corrections, since this way we are in sync with the measurement in dileptons and can profit from the correlations in systematics.

- line 244-247: say why this is of particular importance to this analysis?
    We have many analyses published using b-tagging where we do not particularly spell 
    this out. Here it seems to be more important when looking at table 2...

%BLUE% >> Indeed, the b quark fragmentation is one of the largest modeling uncertainties, as evident from Table 2.
Also we would like to keep these sentences in the style of the rest of the section,
where each source of systematic uncertainty has a brief description.

- check 47,48: Is taking the full difference taken as the uncertainty not too pessimistic?  (what about half?)

%BLUE% >> The results of the papers on top pT re-weighting are further summarized in [[https://twiki.cern.ch/twiki/bin/view/CMS/TopPtReweighting][the prescriptions]] for the re-weighting from the Top PAG group.
We estimate this effect according to the prescriptions. They consider both the measurements in Run1 and Run2.
The variation is measured from the distributions of kinematic parameters, so that the full magnitude covers the difference in the distributions.

- line 257: In the scale variations, are the combinations like (0.5,2) for the independent
  variations of the two scales also included? This is generally considered to be too 
  pessimistic and these combinations shouldn't be included in the systematic uncertainty.

%BLUE% >> Yes, the independent variations of the scales are included.
Together with the simultaneous variation of both scales they form an envelope of the scale variation.
This procedure follows [[https://twiki.cern.ch/twiki/bin/viewauth/CMS/TopSystematics#Factorization_and_renormalizatio][the prescriptions]] from the Top PAG group.

- line 250: FSR/ISR: seems the scale variation with a factor two is too large.
    I believe for one of these (FSR?) the recommended maximum variation is to use 
    sqrt{2}; Please check with some other recent papers where we vary the ISR/FSR scale 
    as a systematic uncertainty

%BLUE% >> The dileptons measurement (TOP-17-001) does vary ISR and FSR by 2.









- line 262: Please add a reference to where these UE uncertainties are discussed.

%BLUE% >> Added.

- line 265: Is there no "model uncertainty" in this full phase space extrapolation?
     I assume here you base yourself on POWHEG alone, by just varying its parameters?

%BLUE% >> Yes. The aMCatNLO alternative as one of the systematics was not considered as it was not recommended.

- line 265: somehow I expected that you would crefer here to table 2 with a summary of 
    all the systematic considered

%BLUE% >> Added a sentence.

- table 1: predictions and observation don't really match well: from the four results we 
   have 1  where the two agree (signal-like in the mu-tau) but for the other 
   3 ones the prediction is significantly higher than the observation. Not a worry?

%BLUE% >>
 The ratio between the bservation and the predictions is about 0.95, which corresponds to what we get in the fit.
 The table does not show the expected variation in systematics, which covers the difference.
 In principle, we could add the systematic uncertainties.
 But they might confuse the reader:
 the table of event yields will show only the magnitude of the uncertainty,
 when the shape plays a role in the fit as well,
 therefore the final impact of the systematics on the signal strength differs from the magnitude of the variation of event yields with the variation of systematics.

- line 286: for clarity I recommend you repeat/give again the fiducial cuts again here.

%BLUE% >> Added.

- line 309/310: Not sure I get the point here. We measure both here and in [9] the   
   hadronic tau decay channel only, right?  We only convert the tau_h result to a full tau 
   measurements by using the tau BR. 
   So it looks to me that it is just a presentation of the number we measure. 
   Or is it something more and am I missing something?
   Btw we write "tau's and taus" in this sentence. Guess we should use "taus"

%BLUE% >> You are correct. And since the uncertainty of tau BR is so small, it can be considered as just a presentation of the number.
But since the other paper does not use it, we have to mention the difference.

%BLUE% Corrected the difference with taus, but left the apostrophe since it was preferred before in the review.

*** Discussion title: Review of TOP-18-005

Dear authors

see below a few suggestion on your draft, whose implementation might be
useful before the start of the CWR, to avoid repeated comments.

Best regards

Andrea





 Abstract, first sentence: I suppose it would read better as "... where
tau_h refers to the hadronic decays of the \tau lepton, and \ell=e,mu."

%BLUE% >> Corrected.

Abstract: last sentence: "all top quark decays" is not equal to
"Gamma_tot", so I suggest "The ratio of the partial width Gamma(t->tau
nutau b) to the total width is measured to be 0.1050 +- ... (syst)."

%BLUE% >> Corrected.

L2: we do not define LHC any more, so "... at the CERN LHC are mostly ..."

%BLUE% >> Corrected.

L3: "... in pairs (t\bar t) with ..." to define here t\bar t rather than later at L5

%BLUE% >> Corrected.

L5: "top quark pair (t\bar t) decay " ==> "t\bar t pair decay"

%BLUE% >> Corrected.

L6-8: I believe this sentence would read better as "In this paper, the
process t\bar t-> (\ell nu_\ell)(\tau \nu_\tau)b\bar b is considered,
where one W boson decays into enue or munum, and the other into
taunutau."

%BLUE% >> Corrected.

L18: is this the "first" for CMS or the first in absolute? In the former case you should say so

%BLUE% >> According to PDG it is the first at 13TeV and the first by CMS. The measurements by ATLAS and CDF were not performed at 13TeV collisions.

L20: here "it" is supposed to refer to two sentences earlier (the
measurement and not the data). To avoid ambiguities I suggest to write
"The measurement is extended to a higher energy and it improves ..."

%BLUE% >> Corrected.

L23: "kinematics" is a discipline, so I suggest "kinematics" ==>
"kinematic properties"

%BLUE% >> Corrected.

L25: strike "M_T" since it is defined (more appropriately) later

%BLUE% >> Corrected.

L26: use penname for "e" in "e\tau_h"

%BLUE% >> Corrected.

L28" "tau" ==> "\tau"

%BLUE% >> Corrected.

L32: rather than using the symbol "BR" you might use "\cal B" (so it
would be one letter)

%BLUE% >> Corrected.

L33: the subscript "h" of "\tau_h" should be in roman font

%BLUE% >> Corrected.

L50: I assume you are using British English, since at L12 you wrote
"flavour". In this case "counter clockwise" ==> "anticlockwise" is
preferred

%BLUE% >> Corrected.

L63-64: since you are referring to "accuracy", there should be an
additional hyphen before "order"

%BLUE% >> Corrected.











L68: since you are referring to "accuracy", there should be an
additional hyphen before "order"

%BLUE% >> Corrected.

L71: "top s-channel" ==> "top quark s channel" (with no hyphen,
according to guidelines)

%BLUE% >> Corrected.

L83: since you are referring to "expected xsec", there should be an
additional hyphen before "order"

%BLUE% >> Corrected.

L83: try to avoid the line overflow

%BLUE% >> Added "\ttbar pair" to move the value to the next line.

L105: anti-kT is not a cone algorithm so the distance parameter is "R"
and not "DeltaR" ==> "... with a distance parameter R=0.4."

%BLUE% >> Indeed, corrected.

L118: no need to use upper-case intitials, and also I believe it's
better to hyphenize ==> "hadron-plus-strip (HPS) algorithm"

%BLUE% >> Corrected.

L128: "kinematics" ==> "kinematic properties"

%BLUE% >> Corrected.

L142: now it would be appropriate to define here "Delta R" since it has
been removed from L105

%BLUE% >> Added the deinition.

L150: "Figure 1" ==> "Fig. 1"

%BLUE% >> Corrected.

Caption of fig. 1: "selected with the requirements described in Section
4" is not needed, since this figure has been quoted in section 4; use
penname for "e" in "e\tau_h"; add "quark" after "top"

%BLUE% >> Corrected.

L154: use penname for "e" in "e\tau_h"

%BLUE% >> Corrected.

L157: "kinematics" ==> "kinematic properties"

%BLUE% >> Corrected.

L159: add a comma after "process"

%BLUE% >> Added.

L162: remove the colon after "as"

%BLUE% >> Removed.

L170: "kinematics of the M_T distribution" ==> "details of the M_T
distributions"

%BLUE% >> Corrected.

L175: "The kinematics of the fitted variables are not tied to the
kinematics of the tau lepton" ==> "The fitter variables are not tied to
the kinematic properties of the tau lepton"

%BLUE% >> Corrected.








L185: not sure, but I believe it's better to write "\tau_h's"

%BLUE% >> OK, corrected.

L187: "single-top" ==> "single top quark"

%BLUE% >> Corrected.

L189: you have already defined "pileup", so "The pileup, trigger and
lepton identification efficiencies, ..."

%BLUE% >> Ok, corrected.

L190: no hyphen in "b-tagging", according to guidelines

%BLUE% >> Corrected.

Caption of fig. 2: "M_T" has already been defined, no need to use here
both the symbol and its description

%BLUE% >> Removed the symbol to keep the Figure more self-sufficient.

L244: you have already defined "pileup", so "The pileup is estimated
from the measured instantaneous luminosity ..."

%BLUE% >> Ok, corrected.

L249: use a dash in "Bowler--Lund"

%BLUE% >> Corrected.

L258: "dataset" ==> "data set", according to guidelines

%BLUE% >> Corrected.

L262: "final-state (FSR) and initial-state radiation (ISR)", with
hyphens according to guidelines

%BLUE% >> Corrected.

L273: use penname for "e" in "e\tau_h"

%BLUE% >> Corrected.

Caption of table 1: use penname for "e" in "e\tau_h"; strike "defined by
the kinematics of the jets in the event as described in Section 5",
since that is redundant at this point; the sentences "The multijet
process ... Section 6" and ""the observed ... expectations" belong to
the main text and not to the table caption

%BLUE% >> Corrected.

Table 1: use a dash in "Drell--Yan"

%BLUE% >> Added.

L278: use penname for "e" in "e\tau_h"

%BLUE% >> Corrected.

Caption of fig. 3: use penname for "e" in "e\tau_h"; "top" ==> "top
quark"; strike "gray" (not referring to colors)

%BLUE% >> Corrected.









Caption of table 2: use penname for "e" in "e\tau_h"

%BLUE% >> Corrected

Table 2: use a dash in "Drell--Yan" (twice); do not use "statistics" to
mean "sample size" or "statistical uncertainty"

%BLUE% >> Corrected.

L289+1: use penname for "e" in "e\tau_h"

%BLUE% >> Corrected.

L293+1: use penname for "e" in "e\tau_h"

%BLUE% >> Corrected.

L293+1,+2,+3: is is "tau" or should it be instead "tau_h" ?

%BLUE% >> Yes, corrected.

L297+1: use penname for "e" in "e\tau_h"

%BLUE% >> Corrected.

L309: "systematical" ==> "systematic"

%BLUE% >> Corrected.

L311: not sure, but I believe it's better to write "\tau's"

%BLUE% >> OK. (Now the vote favors the apostrophe.)

L320: "M_T" definition not needed here

%BLUE% >> Corrected.

L321, 322: "kinematics" ==> "kinematic properties" (or something
equivalent)

%BLUE% >> Corrected.

L327: "tau" ==> "\tau"

%BLUE% >> Corrected with "\ell\tau final state" instead of lepton-\tau.

L332: the inclusion of the Acknowledgement section is mandatory (also for CWR)

%BLUE% >> Added the acknowledgement of a [[https://twiki.cern.ch/twiki/bin/viewauth/CMS/Internal/PubAcknow]["short letter"]].
Can I also add an acknowledgement for my grant?
The grant comes from the Portuguese FCT agency via IDPASC program -- I would like to mention this.
Also can I add an acknowledgement for the local computing resources of the lab in addition to "we gratefully acknowledge the computing centres and personnel of the Worldwide LHC Computing Grid"?

L416: remove ", CERN"

%BLUE% >> Removed.

## on "tauh" in cross section and acceptance

the formula is:

sigma(tot) = N / (L * eff * B(fin.state) * A(fin.state))
and
sigma(vis) = N / (L * eff * B(fin.state))

in our case B includes B(W->tau)*B(tau->tauh)

so "fin.state" is just an indication where it is measured.

# the extrapolation uncertainties in the ratio to dileptons

1) check if the values in the table are correct
   leptau values OK
   dilep  values NOT correct
   check them in the calculation -- they are not included there!
   the uncertainties in the calculation are the old ones from AN, which randomly match to dileptons paper!!
   -- corrected them, returned to old magnitude of uncertainty in the ratio: 7%

2) how are they symetrized? can we asymmetrize our uncertainties?

3) is the sum in quadrature correct in case of PDFs?

4) top quark pT is missing?

if we asymetrize, how is the ratio calculated?

how to make a Down variation in PDFs or top quark pT?

in my case PDFs do not have up or down, each varies in separate direction?

tt ME scale     ∓ 0.3 0.1
PDF             ± 0.8 0.6
Top quark pT    ∓ 0.5 < 0.1
tt ISR scale    ∓ 0.1 < 0.1
tt FSR scale    ± 0.1 < 0.1
UE tune         < 0.1

they are all uncorrelated! so no need to worry, I'm just adding them in quadrature at the end

-- 1) add both variations in qudrature
   2) corrected the table

both in quadrature:
tt ME scale         0.1   0.316227766

 l87: ptmiss was already defined in l23

>> It was already clarified earlier. In l23 ptmiss is introduced, and at L87 we give the precise definition, i.e. it is a negative sum of the momenta of all visible particles.

--> ok, then I suggest to remove the symbol in l23.

%BLUE% >> We´d prefer to keep it, as it does no harm, but OK.

- l168: "Such misidentified τ h also come" --> "Such misidentified τ h also comes"

>> This is plural as it refers to taus in different processes.

--> As it is, it looks singular. Maybe "tau_h's"?

%BLUE% >> No apostrophe. OK.


- l227: PU was already defined in l97, please remove.

>> We keep PU only in the formula (approximately L99), in the text we use "pileup" everywhere, for clarity.

--> this I still do not understand. If you define PU, as you do in l102, why not using the acronym instead of "pileup" in l103, 204, 273

%BLUE% >> We think it is clearer to keep it, as it gives a direct link to the Table.

- Table 2: pileup uncertainty --> pileup

%BLUE% >> OK.

[3]

 - Table 2: it would be good to clarify in the text and caption how you are treating the uncertainties from TOP-17-001, i.e, how you are grouping them to match the same categories in your analysis, and that you are symmetrizing the asymmetric extrapolation uncertainties.

%BLUE% >> Uncertainties are not grouped. They are treated as individual lines, as in Table 2.

- Figure 3: if you want to keep it, please add luminosity info to the plot 

%BLUE% >> Added.



# more comments from Yuta

> L125: please write that, HPS tau can overlap with the jet (otherwise it will lead huge confusion)

>> At this selection stage there is no confusion: one tauh candidate and at least 2 jets are separate objects, and all events have a tauh candidate by the definition of the selection.

But then, L135 (in v14) is very confusing; it sounds like you don't remove overlap with tauh. Also, the categorization based on the jet kinematics L 151 (in v14), you say "all jets in the event includin the tauh candidate". So, these are all very confusing as it is now.

%BLUE% >> Removed "Among the jets separated from the τh by ∆R > 0.4,". It was confusing and unnecessary.

> L153: what do you mean by "maximization of the yields in the two categories" ? All events just falls into one of 2 categories and the total number of events in the signal-like plus BG-like won't change ...

>> Maximization in each category separately. Rephrased it.

I still don't get what you want to say by "maximization of the yields in each of the two cateogries". "yields" means, number of signal events? Having categories won't increase the signal yield, isn't it ? It is just categorization and sum of the two categories will leave the signal yield unchanged.

%BLUE% >> "maximize the number of events in each category", ie not too many in any of the two. We prefer "maximize".

%BLUE% The overall yields do not change, but the fractions of events in event categories do.
The event yields in the event categories are:
N(all events in signal-like) = N(signal events|signal-like) + N(background events|signal-like);
N(background-like) = N(signal|background-like) + N(background|background-like).
We maximize N(signal-like) and N(background-like) to have less statistical uncertainty in each category.
And we maximize N(signal|signal-like)/N(signal|background-like) with N(background|background-like)/N(background|signal-like) to separate signal and background events.

> L154: Can you write the gain by spliting the catogires into 2 ? (I made the same comment before ...)

>> In MC toys performing a fit without MT shape we see that the event categories alone constrain the uncertainty due to the background of misidentified taus from 25% to 5%. A fit to MT shape without event categories constrains this uncertainty from 25% to 2.5%. And the fit to MT shape with event categories we arrive at about 2% uncertainty from misidentified taus. The event categories provide an additional constrain on the background in an independent method.

Why don't you write this explicitly in the paper ? I still don't see any description in v14.

%BLUE% >> We think it is too much detail to write it in the paper. Added the concluding sentence in Sec. 5.

> L205: tau charge mis-ID does not correlate wtih tau ID SF uncertainty. No ?

>> No, they are not correlated.

Then, I thnk you should note use "including".

%BLUE% >> Rephrased it.

> before L280: Can you add SM theoretical prediction? you wrote in the summary that it is in agreement with SM, but you never write theoretical value.

>> We think it is not necessary.

Hmm, but then, How we can convince readers that your mreasurement is consistent with SM prediction (summary). If you don't write this number, I would remove corresponding sentence in summary. 

%BLUE% >> It is written in the summary that the results are consistent with the SM. That is the relevant place where to specify it. To write it earlier (for ex. at approx. L280), it would be an unnecessary repetition.

## post-aproval follow up

- In general, and as already stated, the paper lacks the motivation for the measurements, particularly for reporting R. Also concerning CDF and ATLAS results, explicit comparisons should be made in the introduction and summary, in particular on the precision reached here. The summary could also benefit from adding "compatible with lepton universality" there.

%BLUE% >> Included the note on lepton universality in the summary. But we would like to limit the summary section to the results of the paper. We give the reader the description of our result and corresponding references to other measurements, where the details can be found for possible comparison.
As for the different value measured in our paper versus the paper by ATLAS, we give the exact definition of what is measured and prefer not to go into detailed comparison. However, if you have a specific suggestion we would try to include it in CWR. For example, in the Results section we can add a sentence like the following:

%BLUE% While in~\cite{Aad:2015dya} the partial width is estimated for hadronic $\tau$s,
here $R_\Gamma$ is measured for all $\tau$s by using the $\mathrm{BR}(\tau\rightarrow\tauh\nu_\tau)$
that is determined with negligible uncertainty~\cite{Tanabashi:2018oca}.

- Concerning the numbers, particulary the R_gamma, check everywhere in the paper and make sure correct values are reported. For example what you report in the Result section is different from AN and has a typo.

%BLUE% >> Corrected. The AN numbers are correct, the numbers which were added to the paper are outdated.

- Abstract: R definition: remove "pair" in The ratio of the partial width to all top quark pair decays

%BLUE% >> Corrected.

- L23: Detector does not have the full phase space "visible and full phase spaces of the detector" --> "visible phase spaces of the detector and the full phase space"

%BLUE% >> Corrected.

- L27: "contributing to the previous measurements [4, 5]" is misleading. You need to mention explicitly what was measured in CDF and ATLAS where the latter is different from yours. Substitute this with sth like: This measurement is complementary to similar quantities measured in other hadron collider experiments [4,5]. Then in the measurement or summary section specify the difference with ATLAS.

%BLUE% >> Changed the sentence in the Introduction: "complementing the previous measurements [4, 5]". And rephrased the paragraph in Results to make it clear the \Gamme(top->tau) is estimated instead of \Gamma(top->tauh). If necessary, in Results we could add an explicit statement, as in the answer to the first question.

- L284 and the text around: The R you quote is not correct. It should be the one as in AN. Also you say "divided by Br" which is incorrect. You have the correct statement in the AN. Please modify the paper.

%BLUE% >> Corrected.

- Table 2: it would be good to clarify in the text and caption how you are treating the uncertainties from TOP-17-001, i.e, how you are grouping them to match the same categories in your analysis, and that you are symmetrizing the asymmetric extrapolation uncertainties.

%BLUE% >>

- L305:Add a sentence saying the what is different/similar with the results of CDF and ATLAS

%BLUE% >> We specify exactly what is done in the paper and refer to other papers with other results.

- Figure 3: if you want to keep it, please add luminosity info to the plot

%BLUE% >>




## Yuta's questions

 L8: "... does not include leptons from tau decay" cannot come first before you explain tau decay (L11).

%BLUE% >> Moved the sentence to the end of the paragraph.

L10: i.e. higiher than ... -> so what ?? (I made the same comment before ...)

%BLUE% >> This gives the reader the order of magnitude of the BR. As we stated before, we prefer to keep it as there is no harm from this sentence.

L14: tau -> \tau_\text{h}

%BLUE% >> Corrected.

L15: "prompt" needs some explanation

%BLUE% >> We think it is clear as it is.

L24: for "each final state" -> you should explicitly write, what "each"
means.

%BLUE% >> Corrected.

I agree with Abideh, that, physics motivation should be much more
strengthened.

%BLUE% >> We added the references and we state clearly what is measured in the paper.

L54: alphaS -> \alpha_S

%BLUE% >> Corrected.

L71: The multijet -> The QCD multijet (and also in Figure 1 legends)

%BLUE% >> We removed "QCD" following the suggestion of the LE.

L125: please write that, HPS tau can overlap with the jet (otherwise it will lead huge confusion)

%BLUE% >> At this selection stage there is no confusion: one tauh candidate and at least 2 jets are separate objects, and all events have a tauh candidate by the definition of the selection.
There can confusion with comparison to AN, where a "preselction" control region is defined, which requires at least 3 jets, whether or not they overlap with tauh candidate.

Figure1 caption L3: compared with simulation (histograms).

%BLUE% >> Corrected.

L144: The sentence is too long. I would suggest to break the sentence
here and start the new one.

%BLUE% >> Corrected.

L146: Why you include the tauh for jet triplet considration !? I didn't
notice before, but isn't it just degrade your discrimnation rather than
helping ?

%BLUE% >> In case of the background process tt->l(qq)(bb) the misidentified tauh can come from any of the jets from the hard process.
Notice that the event categories target the background process, not the signal.

L153: what do you mean by "maximization of the yields in the two
categories" ? All events just falls into one of 2 categories and the
total number of events in the signal-like plus BG-like won't change ...

%BLUE% >> Maximization in each category separately. Rephrased it.

L154: Can you write the gain by spliting the catogires into 2 ? (I made the same comment before ...)

%BLUE% >> In MC toys performing a fit without MT shape we see that the event categories alone constrain the uncertainty due to the background of misidentified taus from 25% to 5%.
A fit to MT shape without event categories constrains this uncertainty from 25% to 2.5%.
And the fit to MT shape with event categories we arrive at about 2% uncertainty from misidentified taus.
The event categories provide an additional constrain on the background in an independent method.

L161: global maximum of the likelhood function -> vague

%BLUE% >> We think it is clear as it is. We could implement specific suggestions during CWR.

L162: shouldn't be also the same for other methods ?

%BLUE% >> Rephrased.

L168: first time to use W+jets (define beforehand, possibly in section3)

%BLUE% >> Added the definition in parentheses.

L170: no need to write "(leptonic and hadronica tau decays)", as you already defined in L12,

%BLUE% >> Removed.

L173: PU is not a abbreviation at all. You better define pile-up (PU), if you want to do that.

%BLUE% >> Rephrased.












L176-L182: This paragraph does not mention anything about "BG estimate".  You should move this to appropriate place.

%BLUE% >> Here we discuss the estimation of the background of the misidentified tauh, which is measured directly in the fit.

L179: jet composition is unclear for outside readers.

%BLUE% >> Rephrased.

L194: not clear what you mean

%BLUE% >> We think it is clear as it is.

L205: tau charge mis-ID does _not_ correlate wtih tau ID SF uncertainty.  No ?

%BLUE% >> No, they are not correlated.

L207: visible mass of what ?

%BLUE% >> Added \tauh.

L214: no longer the dominant... -> what do you mean ?

%BLUE% >> Rephrased.

L217: "corresponding variations in the fit" -> vague

%BLUE% >> Rephrased.

L227: you already define PU.

%BLUE% >> Rephrased.

section7: what about the uncertainty related to MC generator ? (Herwig v.s. Powheg ?) did you consider this too ?

%BLUE% >> No, it is not considered (as in TOP-17-001).

L261: As already brought up in the approval, I'm not sure How meaningful
this plot is. I would remove this.

%BLUE% >> We prefer to keep it.

Table2: As already brought up in the approval, I don't understand why, e.g. electron efficiencies got constarined in "combined" (0.2) even if
it is 1.8 in e-tauh only channel. Can you explain ? (Muon efficiencies 0.6% -> 0.6% looks reasonable)

%BLUE% >> The constrain on electron efficiency indirectly comes from the small variation of muon efficiencies. For example, increasing pre-fit variation of muon efficiencies produces proportional increase in the impact of electron efficiencies. This was described in the earlier answer.

%BLUE% The impact of the uncertainty of electrons is significantly reduced in the simultaneous fit in both channels comparing to the impact in the fit to only electron-tau final state. It indirectly comes from the constraints in muon-tau final state and results in two effects, which effectively reduce the effect of variations in electron systematics on the signal strength to the magnitudes of the same effects from muon systematics. One is the constraint on the variation of the nuisance parameters of the electron systematics: the post-fit variation of the nuisance parameter is about 0.7-0.8 of the prefit value. In addition the electron systematics correlate less with the signal strength in the simultaneous fit to both final states than in the fit to electron-tau final state separately, which corresponds to the rest of the suppression of the impact of electron systematics. The best way to look at this effect is to consider the simultaneous fit to both final states as a fit to electron-tau final state + additional constraints from the muon-tau final state: 1) the Poissonian constraints in the bins of Mt distributions in muon-tau events and 2) the constraints on the nuisance parameters of muon ID and trigger. Both of them can be represented as constraints directly onto the parameter of signal strength in the electron-tau final state. These constraints (statistical uncertainty in muon-tau final state, muon ID and trigger) have small 1-sigma deviation of about 1% comparing to the constraint of electron systematics of about 2% (1.8% electron ID and 2.3% electron trigger in the fit in the electron-tau final state). As the result, in the PLR scans of the signal strength and of the impact of the nuisance parameters of electron systematics the signal strength is varied less with respect to the nuisance parameters of electrons. The variation of signal strength is closer to the variation in the fit to only muon-tau final state. The case of the systematics of muons is opposite: the statistical uncertainty + electron systematics are larger than the muon systematics and do not impose significant constraint on the signal strength. Therefore the variation of signal strength with respect to muon systematics is the same in the fits to muon-tau final state and in the simultaneous fit to both final states, which is reflected in the impacts.

before L280: Can you add SM theoretical prediction? you wrote in the
summary that it is in agreement with SM, but you never write theoretical
value.

%BLUE% >> We think it is not necessary.

L297 and everywhere: use same notation; tau or tau lepton or tau-lepton
? (to me, tau-lepton is the best but i leave up to LE).

%BLUE% >> We follow the suggestion of the LE.

L299: transfer -> transverse

%BLUE% >> Corrected.

L301: "in the largest background process" -> not clear what you mean

%BLUE% >> Rephrased.

L301: "In the fit ... tau lepton" -> very vague, and not clear. Also you should use \tau if you want.

%BLUE% >> We prefer to keep it in the Summary. We added a clarification in the Section 5 "Event categories and fit procedure":
In the fit, the signal enters as a free parameter without constraining the kinematics of the $\tau$ lepton.
The kinematics of the fitted variables are not tied to the specific \ttbar signal model considered here, i.e. $\ttbar\rightarrow (\ell\nu_{\ell})(\tauh\nu_{\tau})\cPqb\cPaqb$.

# the question of ratio, to leave it or drop it

The ratio of the cross sec-
tions in the lepton-tau and the dilepton [3] final states σ tt (` τ h ) /σ tt (``) , and the ratio of the
partial to the total width Γ ( t → τ h τν τ b ) /Γ total are also evaluated, contributing to the previous
measurements [4, 5].

-- remove the "ratio"

The ratio of the cross sec-
tions in the lepton-tau and the dilepton [3] final states σ tt (` τ h ) /σ tt (``) , and

The ratio of the partial to the total width Γ( t → τ ν_{τ} b )/Γ_{total} is evaluated
with respect to the measurement in the dilepton final state[3],
complementing the previous measurements [4, 5].


# remaining questions and updates

the approval questions -> paper

* mention CDF and Atlas -- how? say something about precisions?

* Why is the systematic uncertainty related to the electron trigger so much larger than the muon trigger ? Do you understand how the combined value is lower than both ? 

    still not clear why electrons are so much constrained by muons

    the value in both can be lower

    CHECK: the MORE CONSERVATIVE muon recommendations (x2 uncertainty)???
    x2 uncertainty is closer to dileptons

* event yield table, add descrription in the caption

    "Table 1: the definition of bkg-like region needs to be included in the caption. (Is this separation really needed?) Make it clear and mention numbers are prefit "

    add systematic uncertainties??? to say "the agreement is good within the systematic uncertainties"

    OK for now

* systematics table, merge with dilepton systematics

    Table 2 and 4 reduce to 1, remove redundancy; move "MC stat" out of the theoretical uncertainties
    "MC stat" must be separate from modeling

    -- FIRST, update the numbers!

    OK

* remove NLL

    what did Michele say?
    > I think the NLL plot is nice to show. It does not add much but why not including it.

    or improve it?

    let's just add the Y axis title for now

* add tau pT? close to the yields table as an example of good Data-Prediction agreement at main selection

  where?
  at the same place also mention good agreement in pre-fit MT?
  --- it's the beginning of "Results", next to the table with event categories, everything is about event categories there
  at the event selection?
  let's try

  OK

* "improve the systematics description"

    check all the references to the systematics section and clarify these

    in:

      + "Background Estimate", in the general paragraph and about mis-ID taus, and about the normalization of the multijet
      + and about the sys uncertainty of the acceptance

    remove the normalization of the multijet and mention the processes explicitly in the Systematics
    --- did not remove, expanded saying "As one of the processes with mis-ID taus,.."

    OK for now

* "R needs to a better explanation and justification"

    clarify that we divide on BR(tau->tauh) to get to the tau! <-- it is inexplicitly mentioned "by dividing BR(W->tauh)
    like this: "In the ratio, the correlated uncertainties cancel out."

    is it also about calculating R?

    can BLUE be applied to a ratio?
    BLUE is basically a sum, it calculates (x1 + x2)/2, we need the same for ratio, but what's the citation then?

* add somewhere pT plots with TOPPT Up: MET and b jet pT

    to AN, right after control plots

* check propagation to qcd

* update numbers:

    vis cross section
    full cross section
    ratio
    Gamma

    DONE

    anything else?


update the presentation

update AN

add the objects review questions to the twiki


## also questions

unclustered MET uncertainty, from Yuta
-- check if dileptons paper has it
   check the old recommendation
   check possible factor for implementation

TOP PT variation effect on pT distributions: lep pT, MET, tau pT, b jet pT
-- add to AN


## the questions from the Mac, notes from approval

All assets of the paper! table 1 etc

Lepton charge mis-id uncertainty
— state that it is negligible
Also check the values? 5% charge uncertainty that’s way too much???

B-tag jets are found from jets separated from tau
— explicitly clarify in the paper

Mention Atlas result, discuss it
— check their tau ID uncertainty

Tau ID uncertainty is much smaller In legacy rereco
2%
Refit and see the effect of it

MET unclustered
— can fix the MET

pT plots with TOPPT re-weighting
— to see the pT trends fixed

Muon uncertainty is too small?

Electron trigger uncertainty is too large?

Mention in paper how systematics are propagated to QCD

Mention explicitly which processes have the tau mis-ID systematic: QCD, W+jets and tau mis-ID parameters.

Table1: explanation to the table?
Caption on «tt signal» — what it means?
— we over-simplified the table???

Separate line for MC statistics in the table?
— check

Combine tables on systematics from dileptons and ours

Data/Mc -> Data/Expectation or Data/Prediction
Because there is data-driven QCD

Mt in event categories instead of inclusive

NLL plot has no value — either add separation of uncertainties or remove

## improving the NLL plot

add the Y axis title for now, then maybe add the brazil-colors for 1-2sigma

## investigation of strong constraint on the impact of LEPel in fit to "both"

the problem:

LEPelID impact is 1.8 in el-only fit
but it is 0.2 in both fit
when LEPmuID is 0.6 in both

       muon ID efficiency    &  0.6 &  0.6 & 0 & 0 \\
  muon trigger efficiency    &  0.3 &  0.2 & 0 & 0 \\

   electron ID efficiency    &  1.8 &  0.2 & 0 & 0 \\
electron trigger efficiency  &  2.3 &  0.2 & 0 & 0 \\

for reference dileptons:

trigger efficiency     & 0.3 & 0 \\
electron efficiencies  & 1.5 & 1 \\
muon efficiencies      & 1.3 & 1 \\


how el ID can be constraned to 0.2 if the impact of muons is still 0.6?

1) the el variation is constrained, but by only about 0.7-0.8 of magnitude
   it seems not enough to explain this difference in signal strength?

2) is there some additional dumping of the impact of LEPel on the signal strength?
   check by plotting r VS LEPelID in el-only fit and both fit

so, definitely there is a dumping...
it must be comming from muons?



does it happen in toys or is it a coinsidance in observed data?

### uncertainties of the charge misidentification

%BLUE% >> CORRECTION The charge misidentification probability is <0.45% for electrons, but the uncertainty is much smaller and is included in the ID uncertainty.
For muons the charge misidentification and its' auncertainty are even smaller.
But there is no solid reference within EGamma documentation:
[[https://arxiv.org/pdf/1502.02701.pdf][Run1 EGamma performance (page 16)]]
[[https://cds.cern.ch/record/2320638/files/DP2018_017.pdf][Run2 report]]
[[http://cms.cern.ch/iCMS/analysisadmin/cadilines?line=EGM-17-001][Run2 performance paper]] (and [[https://gitlab.cern.ch/tdr/papers/EGM-17-001][gitlab]])
-- the average probability of charge misidentification is 0.2% with a negligible uncertainty on order 0.05%, but it is not clearey stated for the performance in Run2.
One good reference is that TOP-17-001 does not mention the uncertainty of the charge misidentification either.



## are uncertainties taken from impacts actually correct?

is it correct that:
sum of quadratures of impacts ~= estimation of the overal uncertainty,
since each impact is profiled separately?

then is it correct to use these impacts in the ratio?

or must each systematic uncertainty be obtained fin the pilling-off procedure?


## Why is the systematic uncertainty related to the electron trigger so much larger than the muon trigger ? Do you understand how the combined value is lower than both ? 

-- in the simultaneous fit the electrons are constrained by the muon final state,
   1) muons have more events and
   2) different kinematics with more events at hight MT? CHECK -- NO, it does not have more signal events at large MT
   3) and the LEP mu variation is smaller

but the ratio of el/mu at large MT is only about 0.7-0.8
and the fraction of signal is about 0.6-0.85
the impact of electron LEP falls by a factor of 4..

it seems the constrain on electrons in both does come from muons:
fitting x2 larger variation of muon LEP systematics leads to x2 el impacts


## btw check pulls and constrains

LEPel TRG and IF are not constrained in el
in both they are *slightly* constrained: TRG to 0.75 and ID to 0.8
but their impact is much smaller
and muon LEP are not constrained in both

can there be some dumping effect?
I do not see how: even when fitting both
the muons do not dump in el channels!


### check the magnitudes and correlations between ID and TRG in el and mu -- close magnitudes and opposite correlations lead to no impact on signal strength

and correlations between el and mu -- mu dumps el?


### any shape in the variation of mu or el LEP?



### CHECK if muon-tau has more signal at large Mt (better signal separation per MT)

NO, it does not:

aha, so this should be the ratio of the constraint?
and 2.4% electrin trigger should become 0.7-0.8 * 2.4%?
no, what's the logic of this?

The signal varies by 2.4% with el TRG in el channels.
It varies the same in muon channels in the simultaneous fit.
And which uncertainties damn it? Only MC stat and stat?

-- what's the post-fit values?
And "with all other parameters profiled as normal," means they are varied.

## what's needed in ntupler?

which release?
data and MC in 9_4_9
can some correction require something newer?
1) probably no, since this is old stable data
2) if it is required I'll stumble at it during implementation and will update the release

-- has only the correct Scale in Data and Smear in MC

> One thing of note, there is an inflection in the energy scale at ~45 GeV in the 2016 legacy.
> If you are using templates and have an energy range that crosses 45 GeV,
> you will constrain the energy scale to which ever side you have more data (likely <45 GeV) and this will cause incorrect pulls.
> Therefore you should use also "ScaleEt" as a systematic template as well.
> This template is an estimate of the energy uncertainty and the sign switches around ~45GeV so the template is correctly constrained.
> Finally as a warning if any constraint (larger than 90%) is observed in pre(post)-fit results concerning electron/photons energy scale, please contact EGamma/ECAL DPG.

> If you are not sufficiently sensitive to the energy scale and you are just using them as a per bin uncorrelated error for simplicity over correctness,

-- unclustered does have a significant influence, up to 0.3-0.5 difference

JetEn is up to 0.1
JerRes is more like unclustered (?)
MuonEn within 0.07-0.08
ElEn is 0.012 (smaller than muon?)
TauEn within 0.055

### unclustered MET





# plots for the approval

update the control plots with latest formats -- from the ones in AN
+ move nvtx to the backup -- since cannot make a new format plot of it -- no nvtx in stage2!!!
+ add more control plots? (etas?)

   but without full uncertainty
   full uncertainty is only in Mt plots

-- I've got controls in test172! only hadd and plot them
   ! check if all njets etc are there !
   -- met_c is the wide distr

3x2 for each channel
lep pt, lep eta, met, cosine phi, Mt, +???

4x3 for both channels?
tau pt, tau eta, bjet pt, rjet pt, njets, nbjets

- skip bjet eta and rjet eta

-- check latest bins in jet and bjet eta!

let's hadd and plot everything



+ add prefit Mt with full uncertainty
DONE

+ remake the Mt per tau pT with new binning for better stats?
+ remake signal-background plot in the new binning?
DONE

## remake the Mt plots with new binning

the Mt per tau pT with new binning for better stats?
signal-background plot in the new binning?

just plot Mt for signal and background, inclusive and per tau pT
then hadd and compare on plots

-- here on_uncor_lepjets was used and the taujet JER was propagated...
   just repeate uncor lepjets with no JER from tau
   or
   uncor taujets with them?

the JER from tau just gives random fluctuation of 1%
uncorrecting is probably better

probably, if you split PU into epochs you have to renormalize it specially too



check PU pull in mu whith TOPPT=1  <---------- might not mean anything! if PU is broken it won't behave even if TOPPT=1

-- PU does not move

el energy scale? -- why did it never show up?
tau eta < 2.3    -- negligible difference
jet or bjet eta? -- negligibly reduces MC
met trends?      -- in presel TOPPT would not fix the data-mc difference in mu and el
DY dileps eta    -- electrons had more deviation than muons
what else?

what if jer must be propagated from all jets, not just the passing ones?

a problem with prop tau?
a problem with METMuEGClean for data? -- when checked the difference was negligible

# the problem with the fit in muon channel

TOPPT is not pulled up, therefor the signal strangth is lower than in the fit in both channels

reproduce

correlations do not show anything useful???
the parameters affected by setting TOPPPT=1 --- freezing them does not set TOPPT to 1?
    freezing sets them to zero, which is not correct
    --- save all these parameters in NLL scan, check their correlation with TOPPT

--- check FSR variations?
    they affect mis-ID, which affects the signal at low Mt

-- this will lead to unreasonable large uncertainty

what if both problems, the unphysical TOPPT in muons and the bend in electrons, are the same?
-- they are due to some mistake in handling lepton jets



### check how lepton jets are handled now, check the variations

{in the past some procedure for lepton jets drastically and unreasonably increased the data-mc difference
 maybe it was due to that one error in jet-met propagation, which was fixed in data?}

https://twiki.cern.ch/twiki/bin/view/CMSPublic/WorkBookMetAnalysis#Type_I_Correction

MET = - JEC jets - unclustered particles

probably the unclustered include the isolated leptons

so, in principle, the inly thing to propagate is the recalculated JER
and it is not propagated now by default

noooooooooooooooooooooo!
it's not in JER!
JER should not be done on the lep jet, neither propagated to MET!
lep jet is a phantom object that should not exist and neither should its' part in MET.
JES of the lep jet included in the Type1 MET must also be removed.

so, there are 2 options:
1) try to remove only the JES correction
2) try to remove the whole jet from MET

-- and these are done both in Data and MC?

check JES factor in Data and MC

-- 17 strong shift to smaller values, linear +8% to -12%, flattens at very large values, similar el and mu
   18 very stron shift, non linear shape +150% to -75%, flattens at very large values

these shifts propagate to data too, so the final effect is hard to estimate
finish both procedures, test17 first

# more questions on v7

## just make the plot with combined channel only

python ttxsec/fit-stuff/plot_uncertainty_scans.py v37_test15_exp_unc --xsec-scale 831.76 --title-x "cross section [pb]"



## another look at the weirdness in the fitting

the fit in combined channel > in el and mu

the hypothesis is:
this is due to no TOPPT pull up in mu,
which makes the fitted signal strength smaller in mu than in case of TOPPT 1sigma up;
the TOPPT is up in el and in combined;
if mu had TOPPT up the signal strength would be > in combined.

first clue:
in newest fit files the MC normalization is slightly smaller than in fitted histosel datafiles
-- why is that, is it reasonable, does the fit in new files produce larger signal strength in mu?


### check the hypothesis

find the fitted datacards
refit mu with TOPPT set to one

old is exported:
export/v37_test13_bunchFULLFIT2/

but the most recent version in proc/xsec_calculations.jl is v13 test15 paper6
seems to correspond to
scan_mu_v37_test15_exp_unc.png
-- only the sig strength is 0.946 instead of 0.945
but both and el correspond too

-- which datacard was it?

this stuff:

make fit_unc      nn=mu_v37_test15_exp_unc   workspace=ttxsec/datacard_v37_test15_bunchFULLFIT1_mu_exp.root   &
make fit_unc_toys nn=mu_v37_test15_exp_unc   workspace=ttxsec/datacard_v37_test15_bunchFULLFIT1_mu_exp.root   &

let's repeat and confirm the hypothesis

make fit_unc      nn=mu_v37_test15_exp_unc_REPTEST   workspace=ttxsec/datacard_v37_test15_bunchFULLFIT1_mu_exp.root   &

r = 0.946

eog ./scan_mu_v37_test15_exp_unc_REPTEST.png ./scan_mu_v37_test15_exp_unc.png

-- and identical 

nll

make nll  workspace=ttxsec/datacard_v37_test15_bunchFULLFIT1_mu_exp.root   nn=v37_test15_mu_exp_REPTEST

make nll  workspace=ttxsec/datacard_v37_test15_bunchFULLFIT1_mu_exp.root   nn=v37_test15_mu_exp_REPTEST_TOPPT1 freeze="--freezeParameters lumi_13TeV,TOPPT --setParameters TOPPT=1"

 POI: r= 0.945318 -> [0.5,1.5]

-- strangely not 0.946

Set Default Value of Parameter TOPPT To : 1
Computing results starting from observation (a-posteriori)
 POI: r= 0.945335 -> [0.5,1.5]

Set Default Value of Parameter TOPPT To : 1
Computing results starting from observation (a-posteriori)
 POI: r= 0.96354 -> [0.5,1.5]

-- and both is:

bt_sig  = 0.961


----- yeah, the hypothesis is right

the datacard and datafile are:

ttxsec/datacard_v37_test15_bunchFULLFIT1_mu_exp.txt
ttxsec/fit-stuff/v37_test15_bunchFULLFIT1_HISTOSEL.root


### check the first clue

are new files indeed different in normalization?
how do they fit?
why are they different, which correction was applied/changed?

which files are the new files?
-- in the sys uncertainty propagation

### check FULLFIT2 for fit

it is very close to FULLFIT1, but the shape of QCD is smoother, the trend is more linear in large Mt

TOPPT is the most effective in the large and small Mt, where QCD has negligible effect


### error in wjets normalization?

the Mt trend is too linear in muon-tau,
TOPPT bends small and large Mt, fixing the large Mt and failing the small ones,
more wjets would make the bend in Mt, which corresponds exactly to TOPPT

check the effect of TOPPT on the shape, data-mc difference

## justify 60GeV cut in lj categories

check the separation of sig/background and statistics per different cuts for el and mu sel

-- 58GeV did separate them into equal stats, but maybe the sig/bckg separation is better with 60GeV?
   also everything must differ in el and mu

plot the diagram of lj cuts:

S S1 S2
B B1 B2
  C1 C2

min |C1 - C2|
max |S1 - B1|

-- scatter plot for different values of lj cut

   fakes are asymmetric, more so in nocats,
   they are constrained to about the same impact, 7th in usual and 10th in nocats, but the magnitude is the same

   also ISR is one of the largest now

# post-update v37 test13

Three main problems:
1) the fit in both channels is asymmetric from the separate channels
   -- test14 with fixes
      does not change the asymmetry, what happens is the fit in el pulls TOPPT Up, but mu does not
      then the fit in both pulls TOPPT Up too
      this asymmetric uncertainty + the correlated ones switch the fit into another domain of nuisances
      for example, the fit looks perfect without TOPPT, also good without TOPPT and Frag, ok without Frag only

      Frag alone produces too large impact
      -- it is due to new b-frag weights in the ntuples, which have about 1/4 larger variation (the old one around 2% new is 2.5%)
         the weights changed in ntuples themselves since around v35
         the procedure for the weights did not change since than, neither in ntupler nor in BFrag plugin,
         maybe it is due to the switch to CMSSW 8 0 29 from 26?

      it's not clear why TOPPT is not prefered in mu, maybe because ljout is very flat there
      the TOPPT bends the distribution, which is suitable in el, but in mu it is not needed

      both uncertainties can be "shaken" into a different behavior with the change in lj variable (test15)

2) the pulls in muon channel for the systematics:
   JES, LEPmuID, LEPmuTRG, Peterson, TES
   -- FIXED
       the issue is the same in fit with all systematics and with less parameters, it also propagates to the fit of both channels
      there is no such issue in electron channel, el has some issue in Mf and some PDFs
3) DY tautau basic and 3j look strange in the distrs:
   different the composition in lep pT and tau pT (more qcd, wjets in one of them).
   -- NO, IT's FINE! the difference is between eltau and mutau plots!

Also:
1) high MET trends: MC>Data at high MET
   -- the TOPPT in elmu, presel and main selection does not fix them entirely
      it cannot be due to QCD -- it's in high MET, especially at 200-500GeV
   is it the reason of the disagreement in Mt?
   is it fixable with recoil corrections?
2) and lj in muon has too large disagreement?
   -- the fit in el and mu has different conditions, it fits different things, which is probably one of the sources of problems with asymmetry in fit of both channels etc
   actually lj seems similar in el and mu, but in ljout el has the bending trend and very large contribution of QCD, and mu is on contrary quite flat

asymmetric systematics:

TT weight sys look weird (Mf, Mr, Mfr) <- NO, IT's FINE! the MC distrs did not have QCD!
mu LEP                                 <- error with new per-epoch PU, wron place of parentheses
JES, TES and JER                       <- error in the propagation to met

why fit broke when one of the systematics was rate?

check goodness of the fit

is it correlated with W+jets?

which datacard was it?
el was around 1.02 -- the old lumi cert

   also: without TOPPT el drops from 0.96 to 0.92,
         mu stays the same,
         both drops

TOPPT is indeed asymmetric, apparently it works like a switch

   also mu is different from before?

   Frag is too large in both mu and el
   TOPPT is pulled up in el, centered in mu -- why mu does not favor TOPPT?

-- practically the same amount of events (veto leps etc are needed)
   but still the same difference in the distrs!

   red is large in Up and smaller in Down

so, it seems the weight has changed in ntuples?
git shows no difference for this weight:
the genjets come from token particleLevel:jets

        genJetsToken_ = consumes<std::vector<reco::GenJet> >(edm::InputTag("particleLevel:jets")); // not sure if it is different from previous one
                iEvent.getByToken( genJetsToken_, genJets2);

then the loop with weights did not change, only a separate match to leptons was added, which is just added and that's all

how come this weight has changed, but the weight in the histo of sys weights has not?
-- I forgot to divide the sys by central Frag?
   no, I did divide it!
   so, how come?

check separate distrs

but what's the overall effect of this change?

In v37 final variation is:

Up
root [8] 4948.97 / 5135.77
(double) 0.963628
Down
root [9] 5277.82 / 5135.77
(double) 1.02766

from this:

(double) 0.923977
(double) 1.05783

in v26 it is:

root -l ttxsec/HISTOSELS_v25v25redo_PUnormFix.root

(double) 0.972381
(double) 1.02213

from:

(double) 0.973473
(double) 1.02142

so, it's larger by 1% and 0.5% now...

what is reduce these systematics by this amount?

PU was ok:

                weight_lep_pu_PUUp = ratio_bcdef * mu_trg_sf_b * mu_b_trk * mu_sfs_b[3][0] * mu_sfs_b[4][0] * weight_pu_bcdef_up + \

                weight_lep_pu_PUDown = ratio_bcdef * mu_trg_sf_b * mu_b_trk * mu_sfs_b[3][0] * mu_sfs_b[4][0] * weight_pu_bcdef_dn + \
                                          ratio_gh * mu_trg_sf_h * mu_h_trk * mu_sfs_h[3][0] * mu_sfs_h[4][0] * weight_pu_gh_dn

I'm surprised it did not destroy the event yield in these variations.

v37 test14





## check other pull-constrained systematics JES, Peterson, TES

JES does look strange, the 150-200GeV bin especially,
but no such asymmetry as in LEPmu

Peterson is ok, also no difference between el and mu

TES is like JES, the bins at 150 and 200GeV are close to asymmetry
but not like LEPMu

(the only?) difference between nominal jets and variations:

                    if jet_pt > JETS_PT_CUT:
                        proc_met -= p4 * (en_factor - 1.)
                    if jet_pt_JERUp > JETS_PT_CUT:
                        proc_met_JERUp   -= p4 * (jet_factor_JERUp - 1.)
                    if jet_pt_JERDown > JETS_PT_CUT:
                        proc_met_JERDown -= p4 * (jet_factor_JERDown - 1.)
                    if jet_pt_JESUp > JETS_PT_CUT:
                        proc_met_JESUp   -= p4 * (jet_factor_JESUp - 1.)
                    if jet_pt_JESDown > JETS_PT_CUT:
                        proc_met_JESDown -= p4 * (jet_factor_JESDown - 1.)
                    # these were broken! the nominal jer factor was not applied, but now it is.

but:

                        jet_factor_JESUp   = en_factor * (1 + jes_shift)
                        jet_factor_JESDown = en_factor * (1 - jes_shift)

and these:

                        up, down = ev.jet_jer_factor_up[i], ev.jet_jer_factor_down[i]
                        jet_factor_JERUp   = up    if jer_factor > 0 else 0
                        jet_factor_JERDown = down  if jer_factor > 0 else 0

where

				jer_factor = TMath::Max(0., 1. + (jer_sf - 1) * dPt / jet.pt());
				jer_factor_up   = TMath::Max(0., 1. + (jer_sf_up   - 1) * dPt / jet.pt());
				jer_factor_down = TMath::Max(0., 1. + (jer_sf_down - 1) * dPt / jet.pt());
				jet.setP4(jet.p4()*jer_factor); // same as scaleEnergy in the Jet POG example

but I use

            p4 = ev.jet_initial_p4[i]

-- so, here I do not need to divide by nominal JER!
   the jet has only JES applied,
   I multiply by jer with en_factor
   then I multiply by JER Up Down to get the variations
   -- but! jet_pt already inlcudes JER?

            jet_pt  = p4.pt() * en_factor
            jet_eta = p4.eta()
            possible_jet_pts = [jet_pt]

and

            jet_pt_JERUp   = jet_pt
            jet_pt_JERDown = jet_pt
            jet_pt_JESUp   = jet_pt
            jet_pt_JESDown = jet_pt

-- JER is wrong

but then I do:

                        jet_pt_JESUp    = p4.pt() * jet_factor_JESUp  
                        jet_pt_JESDown  = p4.pt() * jet_factor_JESDown

and what I propagate to MET?
-- MET is equalized with initial jets
   I correct them by JER factor for nominal and by systematic factors for the rest
   these factors are propagated to MET

   so I need 1 factor for each jet variation, which includes full correction

so, now the factors for MET propagation are correct, but the pT of systematic jets are not




what's the problem with TES?

                taus_main.append((p4, (TES_factor, TES_factor_up, TES_factor_dn), tau_pdgID, i, tau_ID, jetmatched))

        event_met_lep_mt_TESUp   [0] = transverse_mass_pts(lep_p4[0].Px(), lep_p4[0].Py(), proc_met_TESUp.Px(),   proc_met_TESUp.Py())
        event_met_lep_mt_TESDown [0] = transverse_mass_pts(lep_p4[0].Px(), lep_p4[0].Py(), proc_met_TESDown.Px(), proc_met_TESDown.Py())

-- and propagations and pT cuts look ok

'TESDown':  lambda ev: ev.event_weight,
'TESUp'  :  lambda ev: ev.event_weight,

'TESUp'    : lambda ev: ev.event_met_lep_mt_TESUp,
'TESDown'  : lambda ev: ev.event_met_lep_mt_TESDown,

damn!

    proc_met_TESUp
    proc_met_TESDown

-- they don't get all the nominal JER propagation!!!

-- LEPmu are perfect

   TES is good, except bins at 210-220GeV

   JES more bins flipped

   JER most bins are asymmetric from NOMINAL

   the others are stat deviations, often asymmetric from NOMINAL
   and they were made with wrong selection_stages-s
   -- with correct selections:
      TES and JES - much better
      but still in some bins TESUp < NOMINAL and TESDown > NOMINAL?
      JER -- still crapy, in most bins variations are on one side of NOMINAL
             and the variations are close each other, they are just shifted to a side of NOMINAL

what's with JER in the other (muon) channel?
-- same stuff

since the variations are often close to each other, it looks like some nominal stuf is not propagated to them

all ok, just confused the el and mu selection stages!



### check JER in pdb

the problem is:
the JER deviations are well withing stat uncertainties, but they don't look like stat fluctuation:
they are closer to each other than the stat uncertainty and consistently asymmetrically off the nominal

   cannot be a fluctuation then, can it?

   JERUp   = NOM + x
   JERDown = NOM - x

   x = +- 0.27

   so both variations have bin-by-bin migration in both directions of 0.3 GeV magnitude -- within 1 bin or maximum between neighbors
   but why does it even out so well that they look closer to each other than to NOMINAL at the end?

it is the migration of thin layer between neighbor bins!
the migration of thin layer between bins leads to variations proportional to differences between heights of neighbor bins
if Up and Down vary in both directions equally (as in my case) the result for both is the same
and it depends on heights of the given bin and its' neighbors

if it is so, then the difference of heights of neighboring bins should matter

the expected deviation must be proportional to 2nd derivative:
for bins [N-1][N][N+1] the central bin N varies for both Up and Down close to
(N+1) + (N-1) - 2*N

   the problem is that the flow from mult 50 is also close in the magnitude
   the choice of these bins changes the whole flow and the flow is already comparable to the difference in systematics

   the bin width should = to JER variation of met
   does it depenp on nominal met?

-- the 0.25 layer already contains as much events as the JERUp variation kicks out of the bin
   but from the original 320 events which leave the bin only 83 are in the 0.25 layer

   this non-gaussian shape of JER breaks the locality and neighboring layers

so, is a good estimation of the number of events leaving and entering the bin possible?
"good" means the estimation does no suffer from fluctuations

this trend is not destroied by the fluctuations -- fluctuations are smaller than the trend therefore there should be a method to estimate it

320 events leave, hom many enter? the magnitude of the overall flow?
for the same bin check events entering it

ttree_out->Draw("event_met.pt()>>h(100,0,50)", "(event_met.pt() > 12.5 && event_met.pt() < 25.) && (event_met_JERUp.pt() < 12.5 || event_met_JERUp.pt() > 25.)", "col")

## DY tautau plots, different process yields

which plots?

No! It's fine, the difference is between mutau and eltau!
eltau has less true tau contribution and more fakes.
Probably there are less DY tauel-tauh events due to higher pT cut on the electron.

## trends at 500GeV MET

maybe the nominal MET propagation (JER factor) is wrong? Or TES?
-- check their variations
recoil corrections? -- they are too small?

1) compare to initial met
2) which processes dominate the met tail? check process composition in the met tail
3) how does it look in controls: DY, WJets, tt elmu?

in controls:
WJets are surprisingly flat
DY mumu seems ok, elel has slight trend (but it is upto 250GeV)
elmu has the trend, TOPPT almost fixes it (what's in tight elmu, when the jet requirements are the same as in main selection? and in elmu both leptons are 30GeV now!)
tt presel, sel do have the trend, maybe in el it is larger, and it seems in sel it is larger than in presel

-- the same, but slightly worse


overall it should not be a large problem, it seems to show up only in tt and it is mostly fixed by TOPPT
however, it's strange, and maybe it is due to some small correction, like propagating lep-matched jet etc

side question: how come tt_elmu is different from these two? TES propagation?




## issues with lj division?

el ljout looks strange: a bending trend and too large QCD

it seems the jets are added to the jet collections with any(jet_pt > cut for jet_pt in all_jet_pt_per_sys)
not only nominal jets are considered
but does it matter much?

-- slightly different, the red is smaller at low values

lj_var_test14_1->Divide(lj_var_test14)

ok, then let produce it for refit
test15

TODO: so, actually I need separate jet collections of JES, JER (and TES?) jets for separate lj variables?





how does bFrag affect lj categories? do they correlate?

-- gigantic Frag 4%?
   some of main systematics are asymmetric

TOPPT is still not prefered in mu, though it is slightly pulled up.


try reducing frag by 1/4?

try different Mt distribution, more bins?
